45,Tajmahal,Business with A Little Pleasure Mixed In,"The Taj Mahal an immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage. This is a UNESCO site."
45,Tajmahal,Unbelievable and Much Improved,"I visited the Taj Mahal again after having seen it 30 years ago. I was very pleased to see how much better kept this unbelievable jewel is today than back then. The landscaping is kept in order, the reflecting pools are filled, and the marble and stones have been cleaned. This is an incredible monument to visit given its scale (24 stories high), its beauty, and the story behind it."
45,Tajmahal,Beautiful,"It is definitely a must see in your lifetime. It's amazing how large it is and to think they hauled in the marble from miles away is baffling. Stop and notice the gem inlay work. The challenging part was dealing with the crowds. I would highly recommend a guide. We used Atul Tours and Travels. Check them out on fb. Line this up ahead of time. Ask for Sandeep Verma. He took good care of us. He helped us avoid the long lines and showed us the highlights. It will be more relaxing with a guide! It can definitely be overwhelming, but a must see. It is an amazing structure and a beautiful love story. Lastly, opt for the rickshaw ride to the entrance. It's a long walk, plus the rickshaw ride was fun."
45,Tajmahal,Agra Visit A Memorable One,"Travelling to Agra was fun as it was my first journey to Agra and I was quite enthusiastic about it. It took me around 4 hours to reach Agra and the driver was quite cooperative and friendly. His name was Rahul and he cared for us all through the journey.We were 6 people so we booked an Innova car from Delhi. The seats were pushback seats and at every moment driver was considered about our well being. At last we reached Taj, our guide was quite knowledgeable and he explained us about the history of the sites. My experience was quite similar to most of the reviewers on here--the pick up and drop off at the hotel was easy and pleasant. The Taj was mesmerizing and full of beauty. We were spell bound when we had first look of it. Everything was fine expect for the fact that we owed money to our guide for battery cars and shoe covers, but that is part and parcel of travel and we paid him the full amount. Initially we thought of coming to Agra by express train but as we were ending our journey, we thought otherwise and were thrilled by the enchanting experience."
45,Tajmahal,"Worth the visit, even if it's hot and muggy","Worth every Rupee of the ticket (Had to pay VIP ticket, no ID).... Don't forget to visit the museum on the property as well."
45,Tajmahal,Simply cannot be missed!,"It is as good as one imagines! Go early in the morning to avoid the crush. Also make sure that you bring a torch and look for the orange stones, called cornelian, inside the Taj. When you shine a light on them they glow as if they are backlit. Another small slice of magic in this wonderful place."
45,Tajmahal,Nice place,"Best place in all of Agra, and the reason everyone comes. Coming in the summer is really hot, but it's a lot less busy. Lots of touts on the streets outside of the Taj Mahal."
45,Tajmahal,Astoundingly beautiful,I love marble and everything there was just... beautiful. It was also a great opportunity for us to dress up in traditional Indian costumes (sari for girls) and take amazing photos to remember for a lifetime :)
45,Tajmahal,Simply stunning,"For me it was one if those jaw dropping moments. It really is beautiful as are the gardens. We had a guide which was useful for knowledge and stopping the other would be guides from pestering us. I would strongly advise going at sunrise or sunset, it's cooler and quieter. We chose sunrise and it was well worth the early start."
45,Tajmahal,Breath Taking,A must see at early morning the light at that time provides a dreamlike quality that stops you in your tracks. The details of the inlays on the marble are an art form that is still in existence. No photos can do the Taj justice - a must see.
45,Tajmahal,Taj is Taj,Very beautiful monument. It has a great history and you need a guide to explain it in detail. We took a lot of pictures with Taj mahal in the background.
45,Tajmahal,Make it a point to visit every time we are in Agra,We keep coming to Agra occasionally on our official trip and have seen Taj Mahal so many times but we still make it a point to visit Taj mahal on every visit
45,Tajmahal,Must visit monument,
45,Tajmahal,As good as the pictures,As good as the pictures. Worth the money for a guide but negotiate hard for a good price. Go at sunrise before all the tourists get there
45,Tajmahal,Fascinating,Simply Awesome. It was heavenly. It is really an wonder of the world. Please be with your partner while viewing the mausoleum for the first time.
45,Tajmahal,Must see,"Beautiful. More people than I thought. Two of minarets had scaffolding on but wasn't too bad. The marble did it for me, so beautiful marble. They are still refurbishing the ten minute walk to the entrance it will be nicer in 6 months or so I think government spending a lot cleaning it up but almost finished.  Only 10,000 entrance for foreigners. That's if your a independent traveler. I just brushed off all the annoying people offering walking tours."
45,Tajmahal,8th Wonder of World,Taj Mahal is indeed wonder of the world. You would see this when you would actually see this in reality. It's size and beauty is awe inspiring. The architecture is simply amazing and inside the tomb is even more beautiful. You have to see it to believe it. Highly recommended for a visit during stay in Agra.
45,Tajmahal,Amazing Wonder,Awesome experience. i feel so lucky to visit this wonderful place. One of the 7 wonders of the world. The beauty of the marble works inside is spectacular and it was a very memorable moment of my life. Enjoyed each moment of that Taj visit.
45,Tajmahal,Must see in India,"Well the sight is a must see in India. It is very crowded! So at the entry and on exit take care of your belongings. Also when you visit Taj, they do not allow any backpacks or any sort of bags in really, so leave most of your stuff to the hotel. Also cigarettes are not allowed inside, so if you happen to have it with you, you need to give those up. So best is to go only with camera or a phone and that's about it. There is no dress code and it's closed on Fridays. When we went, was really busy! We went around 4 o clock, but more quiet would be morning time."
45,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,It was more beautiful than I ever anticipated. My hair stood up on my arms when I first saw it.  We had an excellent guide arranged by The Oberoi. He gave us a lot of information and history which I appreciated.  We made the mistake of getting a 'photographer'. It was expensive and I think we had about 5 photos that were any good but paid USD100 for 60.  We went late afternoon which was perfect. Daytrippers had departed and it was starting to cool down.  I will always remember this day.
45,Tajmahal,Worth the visit,This is as amazing as I thought it would be. I went here for a day tour and it did not disappoint. Definitely worth the 4 hours travel from Delhi.
45,Tajmahal,7 wonders of the world - amazing,Taj Mahal is beautiful. Try to go in the early hours so as to avoid the rush. You will be able to enjoy the beauty of the Taj in less crowd. Please do carry id proofs for all members else no entry. Please do not be fleeced by guides as they make you feel you will miss so much if you do not take them. The real beauty lies in venturing yourself and enjoying at your pace.
45,Tajmahal,Never to be forgotten experience.,"I travelled from Udaipur to Agra just to visit the Taj Mahal and it was worth the effort. I stayed in an hotel called Sai Palace in the old town. within walking distance and bought my entry ticket the day before. I was able to gain entry very early before the tour groups descended from their many busses. I could freely wander through the garden taking in many of the aspects if this magnificent structure. As you approach more and more detail is visible. To sit on a bench and drink in this enormous beautiful building, was reward on its own. I found the whole experience uplifting and spiritual. After I had been there about 3 hours the masses arrived and visibility inside the Taj was hampered.  Next time I would go inside sooner and finish enjoying the gardens afterwards.  The street leading away from the Taj had many little curio shops and the surrounding area was full of the most incredible aromas of freshly cooking, potato cakes, samoosa and other tempting hot dishes, (snacks) fascinating trip. Unfortunately I have still not mastered cooking the Indian omelette.! PS although there were signs everywhere inside regarding No photographs, everyone was merrily snapping away. Remember. You cannot take in your own water. It is provided free with your ticket. Show respect with your clothing. Sunhat is good idea. ENJOY"
45,Tajmahal,Majestic beauty,"Our visit to the Taj Mahal was lovely. It is super hot in the area so I recommend that one visits the Taj as early in the morning as possible. Lines were long,but it was worth it to see this gorgeous site. We stayed at the Marriott, arriving the day before our planned visit, and it was absolutely lush, one of my favorite Marriotts.  Wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to put booties over your footwear,as one cannot go into the Taj without them. Do not bring a backpack or any food or water into the area; it will be confiscated! There are stalls outside where postcards and other souvenirs may be purchased. We found them to be less expensive than in the hotel gift shops."
45,Tajmahal,Another dream come true,"We had an amazing trip to Taj Mahal we were supposed to go at 4pm the day we arrived so it was postponed until 6 am the next morning because of heavy rain. It was perfect timing to see the Taj Mahal at dawn, the crowds were more manageable and with a great guide we spent a very special time hearing the love story and romance behind the Taj Mahal. I was very disappointed though to see rubbish lying here and there around the grounds....there should be enough staff around to keep the grounds as clean as they deserve to be. In the first place I am surprised that people think it's ok to throw their rubbish on the ground as there are plenty of bins. Take your rubbish with you and find a bin"
45,Tajmahal,it is all that they say,"Amazing in all aspects. The history, the architecture, the culture, the environment. The science that went into this work of art is incredible."
45,Tajmahal,Amazed !!!,"So many times i visit ""Taj Mahal"". every time i get new feel. the one only palace of love. The great Taj Mahal.  No Word !!!"
45,Tajmahal,Ultimate Historical Weekend Spent By Availing Naswiz Holidays Package,"My dad was planning for a visit to Taj Mahal from quite sometime and finally we made it on June 17th. We wanted to explore Taj Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri and other famous things in this city hence we booked our stay in Agra for one night and two days with Naswiz Holidays. Indeed Taj Mahal is a marvelous wonder of historical architecture which looks new each day. Everything about this monument is mesmerizing and appealing. We took a lot of photographs that day and thoroughly enjoyed our short trip. Also, the accommodation provided byNaswiz Holidays was extremely luxurious and we loved the food that came as complementary. Naswiz's services not just simplified our travel stay but also made our travel experience a lot fun."
45,Tajmahal,Views of the Taj,"The best place to view the Taj from was from the Agra Fort, as you get a glorious view of the Yamana River and the Taj."
40,Tajmahal,Well worth a visit,"We visited during a trip to Delhi and were about 2 1/2 hours on a bus, straight down the highway to Agra, very easy journey and great to see some of the sights in between.  When you come off the highway you are right into the thick of it and the hussle and bussle of a local market town. We had to stop regularly for herds of Bulls.  The Taj is an impressive sight even from afar. We nipped into the Oberoi as a base, not cheap but if you can stretch to it then use it as they gave us a run down in the buggies to the site. Walking down to the entrance is fine, loads of people trying to sell Lots of things but very polite and not pushy.  Small queue to get in and small fee, one rate for locals and one for tourists which is fair enough. It is very busy and we went there on a quiet day!!  Inside is amazing, long walk down through other parts is ten site to the Taj itself and it is a truly Memorable experience. A kings tribute to the love for his wife certainly makes an impression. Unfortunately a couple of the minarets are under scaffolding just now, so not quite the clean view I would have wanted.  Getting up close, you out on show covers or take shoes off- would suggest the former. The white marble is beautiful and make sure you just lay a hand on it! Inside the Taj itself is manic. It's only a small door in and out and there are thousands of people so keep your hands on everything and head down as we don't do queueing here! You come out on the riverside and it is somehow very serene away from the hubbub.  The guys with cameras will follow you everywhere and I figured if they were looking for 50 rupees per photo then why not buy a few. My advice is grab your many early, tell him what you want and then meet him immune way out for payment and collection. He will give you hard prints.  Loved it, well worth a trip, the history, the culture, the story, the people- a pleasure!"
40,Tajmahal,Just trying,"Checking this out in order to see how it works from within. Need to type more it seems, so here I am typing again to complete the character requirement"
40,Tajmahal,Simply beautiful,"In India where everything else seems chaotic this is an oasis of calm and beauty. Breathtaking and I'd love to go back. I know it all sounds cliche, and it probably is but it's one of the most stunning pieces of architecture I've ever seen."
40,Tajmahal,Stunning as expected! Read for tips.,"In my experience the best time to visit the taj is midweek in the morning, which is when the crowds are less disruptive and more bearable. The western gate is normally far more busy than the eastern gate, thus I'd highly recommend using the latter.  Driving polluting vehicles close to the taj is prohibited, so for the eastern gate at least we had to stop a distance away and cover the rest of the journey to the taj on an electric bus (a very small fee charged for the bus). I imagine a similar arrangement is in place for entry through the western gate.  When buying tickets you'll be given two shoe covers that you will need to wear on top of your shoes/footwear to be allowed onto the main marble square that the taj sits on. I'd HIGHLY RECOMMEND hiring a (government certified) guide for your visit as the information given allows greater appreciation of the monument.  Hiring a photographer is also not a bad idea if the photography is sufficiently important to you. Many photographers are available on the site itself, and an advantage of having one is they'll be able to clear the crowd for you at popular photography spots.  I'd recommend wearing light clothing as it is quite humid on site due to the Yamuna river being next to the taj. Carry as few items as possible (i.e. water and photography equipment/phone) to the site as there are many restrictions for security reasons."
40,Tajmahal,Ultimate building of eternal love,"This building is an architectural wonder based on pure symmetry. It is the same from all four facades. There are many optical illusions in its stome decorations. According to the guide, Shah Jahan was planning to build a copy of it from black marble for himself on the opposite side of the Yamuna river. This is a masterpiece of srone carving, decoration and engineering ahead of its time. Foreigners pay 1000 INR for the entrance but also given a bottle of water and a pair of shoe covers for free just next to the box office."
40,Tajmahal,Must-see place!!,This is a must-see place!! More beautiful than pictures. I would recommend going in the morning or in the evening. It is too hot during that day and the sunrise or sunset on the structures are absolutely breathtaking.
40,Tajmahal,Locals(Indians) don't appreciate its beauty,"Went with a group of locals on a tour.  When you arrive you need to walk about 500 meters or so to get to the ticket booth. There are autos (tuk tuk) offering rides. The walk is not too bad. But if you feel you wanna take one it I'll only take you so far. There is construction happening (July 2016) so you would still walk a bit.  When you enter, if you are a foreigner you'll be charged R1000. Which includes socks for your shoes for protection of the monument. Do not buy them from the kids pedaling them outside.  Your bags gets checked before you can enter. Like many places in India there is a male and female line. Make sure not to bring anything besides camera, wallet , and water. Candy, food and things they don't recognize will be thrown it kept. Chargers or batteries along with cables will be taken away. They are very strict about this and can get loud thinking you would suddenly understand if they do.  Once you enter you have to go through the courtyard. You can see it in the background. The monuments is under restoration so some parts are covered but you can still walk through and enjoy it's beauty. The locals in my group kept saying how it was dirty, that I should go during full moon, and were apologizing for the state it was in. In my eyes it's one of the most beautiful and romantic buildings ever built. But they feel it's not up to their standards. And some men were saying how it wasn't romantic at all.  The monument itself is an off white because it hasn't been kept in a while, though it's something they are working on. No pictures allowed inside the actual building. Toilets are free for foreigners so make sure you don't pay to use them. Over all it can take 2-3 hours to walk through everything."
40,Tajmahal,The Best,"I have visited so many places but when I saw Tajmahal, it's really such a most beautiful ever I have seen in my life. Tremendous, outstanding, marvellous...love it from the heart"
40,Tajmahal,Beutiful,"By looking at Taj mahal I can just think of one word and that is BEAUTIFUL.We also saw Tajmahal during the night from a distance, it looked even more beautiful. During full moon it looks even more beautiful."
40,Tajmahal,Wow,Visited thrice over past decade and a little more. All the three visits were memorable. It is a world famous monument ...not sure what to add about the place that's not covered as yet :)  Approach roads are a mess and also the locals haggling with tourists that are just irritating.  With each subsequent visit the entry and exit arrangements seemed to be a tad better.. that's all
40,Tajmahal,Nothing compare to.... Taj Mahal,It's a superb place to visit very suggestive and magnificent. Beautiful garden. Visiting it at the sunrise is amazing. No many people around and it is possible to enjoy it fully. Pity that the museum does not open until 9.00
40,Tajmahal,Stunning. Beautiful. Magical.,We visited the Taj Mahal last week and although we have chosen the hottest time of the year (humidity wise) it left us breathless. It's a must do when Visiting India.  Note to travellers and tourists... The 'Government Tourist' staff that provide you with your shoe socks and free bottle of water after the ticket office then give you a very hard sell about how long the que is and would be better to pay the £950 rupees to a tour guide to fast tract you meaning you a miss the que - you DO NOT NEED TO - the tourists and foreigners have a separate que so we were inside within 5 minutes so just make your way to the que and the staff show you where to join the tourist que.
40,Tajmahal,Wah Taj!!,"The first glance of Taj in the winter morning is amazing. The whole monument will look very smaller while you are entering inside the Taj premises but as you progresses towards the main structure, it will look so huge and beautiful that will make you say ""Wah Taj"".  Absolute beauty in white marble with verses in farsi inscribed on the Taj.  Just BEAUTIFUL"
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful,"You have to pay for an expensive ticket so you don't waste time standing in the line. Once you get in, there will be many people offering to take pictures of you for a fee. It's up to you if you want it or not. When you get past all of that and see the Taj Mahal you will be lost for words. It's absolutely beautiful and the detail on the building is fantastic."
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal made me speechless,"Never thought that it would be so beautiful, was comparing this place with some other wonders of the world but the fact is there is no comparison of this place with any other monument of the world as far has beauty concern, simply making you speechless."
40,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,It's worth the hype. The architecture truly is spectacular. Take a moment to go upclose and look at the detail in the marble. My recommendations:  1. Go early. Like really early. Less crowds.  2. Some young men will approach you to help you take pictures. I almost never indulge this but I did and it was worth it because I really did have great pictures- he knew the best angles and places. Tip him well. You're on vacation.
40,Tajmahal,July Visit,Hot yes but a lot less tourists. Most of the experienced local photograpers take excellent shots and are not that expensive and they don't mind taking USD. Do not go with backpacks as they will not be allowed in. Lockers are provided at your own risk. No need to take off shoes. Protective coverings available
40,Tajmahal,Great day at Taj Mahal,Try to get an early start if you are buying tickets at the entrance. Best to buy the tickets along with any sort of tour package. And makesure you have a guide that speaks English as well as Hindi. We purchased the day trip tour package from New Delhi to Agra thru Zip Trips. Great company. Great service. The driver picked us up at the hotel and had made all the arrangements at the Taj Mahal with the guide. We got the tickets with the package which was lot easier instead of waiting in long lines out there. We truly had a wonderful visit.
40,Tajmahal,Really Amazing to View at Sunset,"This is one of the greatest architecture and the view of it is fantastic at any time, but if you want to feel the difference, watch it at sunset. It's really gonna blow your mind, its beauty and charm is amazing."
40,Tajmahal,Mumtaj - What is more beautiful a Mortal or a Monument,"The best time to watch Taj and avoid the huge local crowd is early morning or at Dusk. Avoid weekends and Friday(official close). If it is your first visit to the monument then make sure you arrive in Agra on the previous night and visit Taj early morning. Visit the UP Tourism website for the timings and other finer details. We drove early morning from Delhi to Agra using Taj Expressway; weather was pleasant throughout the day and it rained heavily on our return same day. Did not get stuck anywhere due to rain though.  There is a R&R somewhere halfway through the trip.  Exiting Highway: We exited highway using NH93 which is very crowded and not recommended. Coming back we used AH1 which is less crowded and could stop by a restaurant known as Raj Ki Rasoi. One of cleanest place for food and sweets.  Entry to Taj: Use East gate for the entrance to Taj as it is less crowded and suitable for overseas tourists. Entry to West gate is very crowded and it is being renovated.  Use a Guide: Paid a meagre sum of INR300 and hired a local guide who was very good and professional in explaining the finer details in building the Taj. Since we were accompanied by one of overseas colleague, we were spared from standing in long queues. Avoid handbags to save yourself from security checks.  Overall, what a wonderful experience it was!!"
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,"Wanted to see this place for as long as I can remember and was worried that because of the anticipation I would be disappointed, I couldn't have been more wrong... The most magnificent sight ever!!! I defy anyone to be unaffected by the monument, I was so very emotional and didn't want to break the spell by leaving. I will definately return as often as I am able."
40,Tajmahal,Be prepared to be awed,"While I've read a lot about Taj Mahal, nothing compares the feeling of seeing it in real life. We went there at sunrise, sunset and poornima (full moon) night viewing. The Taj Mahal even looks heavenly at full moon but alas it is difficult to take any decent photo as it quite dark and the moon is on the opposite side. It is highly suggested to get a tour guide to know more about the story of Taj Mahal. Sunrise viewing is also the best and while we went there just in time for the monsoons, we are so lucky that the rains stopped on the very day that we visited the Taj Mahal."
40,Tajmahal,An Amazing Tomb,"We enter from the East Gate, the security is tight, only hand carry small bag are allow to enter. Looking through the main entrance building, the Taj Mahal slowly grow in size. Once through the door, the whole Taj Mahal attracting multiple ""wow"" from us. Is so beautiful, so grand, look so pure in all white, pearl white. Slowly we walk toward it and our heart beep getting louder. Along the way we were told of it great story, the meaning of the 22 small dome on the entrance building, the history of the king building this great Taj Mahal and the other related love/sad tales. The main building marble stone wall was crafted with gem stone to form all the beautiful flowers and patterns. Some of the marble wall were hacked to form uniform and symmetric ventilation hole. Natural wind blow through the inner part of the building, feel cooling even we visited in a hot, humid day.  Overall is a amazing experience and should be in the must go list of all India visitor."
40,Tajmahal,the gradnour of the place is not to miss,"this place is wonderful. I dont understand why people dont like it. i really enjoyed my time. It was truly stunning, It is a bit smaller in real life than pics portray it to be. It was easy to get to, and not expensive to get in. I really advice going in April or in May, so the weather is not as hot. I went at 8 am in AM it was still 100 outside! also, it is super busy and crowded with locals and tourist, the earliest you go the better pics to get. allow at least 1hr, make sure to visit the red fort as well, no one ever goes there too. highly recommended!"
40,Tajmahal,"Just a word "" Wah Taj""","This is all I can say when ever I visit Taj Mahal ""Wah Taj"". Being an localities we have to visit Taj often either with family relatives or freinds, everytime I visited taj the beloved shahjahan inside my heart wakes up and motivates me to do something for my wife. Its a true monument of Love."
40,Tajmahal,It's the Taj Mahal,"Info: cigarettes, food and such are not allowed and you have to throw it away. Phones and guidebooks are allowed. Guides of various quality outside and some photography ""helpers"" inside who can be very persistent... 1000 INR for foreigners for entrance. Spend at least three hours or more. Go at sunrise."
40,Tajmahal,Taj mahal,White wonder all the freshness peace adorable n to be remembered whole life with lots of satisfaction having visited a great monument
40,Tajmahal,Lovely place,This was our third trip to Taj but as always it was fascinating and enjoyable. An early morning visit helped avoiding large ques and crowd. Had to use the washroom and found it to be very neat and clean.
40,Tajmahal,One of the finest and memorable symbol of love.,A stunning architecture and workmanship of flowless marble is one of the seven wonders in the world.
40,Tajmahal,Awe Struck,Amazing. So beautiful. So happy I made it. I see why it is a wonder of the world. It was HOT but worth it. The marble is beautiful.
40,Tajmahal,once in a life time one has to see,"amazing especially early in the morning. It is good to come night before and stay in a nearby hotel , to have a short walk just when the sun rises to Taj Mahal."
40,Tajmahal,Simply Stunning!!!,"No words to describe! What a creation - breathtaking! not easy to get the perfect shot without anyone on it, but its a memorable feeling just being there."
40,Tajmahal,Taj from river side too,Definitely have to go inside but it is worth vising from river side ( mehtab Bagh) too. It is better to go on sun rise in side.
40,Tajmahal,More stunning in person,This is the only reason to go to Agra. Go early at sunrise before the tourists. It will still be busy but probably 1/3 as busy as later in the day
40,Tajmahal,Best Wonder in the World!,This place is an oasis of calm and beauty. The architecture and magnificence of the building is jaw dropping. If you do one thing in life then visit the Taj Mahal.
40,Tajmahal,Awesome Taj,Dream came true for me when i visited Tajmahal with my wife. Our guide Mr. Varun Gupta made it all easy for us. He is simply an awesome guide and photographer. I would like to recommend him for others.
40,Tajmahal,Fabulous!!!!,"It was on my bucket list. We went to get the ticket around 5 am, and got into Taj Mahal on 5:30 am, it was quite, peace and wonderful. And we were lucky enough have a door guy called Dom who works there over 40 years took us around and took photos for us too. We paid him some tip in the end as well because he was really friendly and nice."
40,Tajmahal,Wah Taj....,I am completely in love with this monument and used to visit this place with my wife every year and become young again at heart. This place gives divine purity to the heart and provides inner peace to me. I visited Taj last weekend and was left astonished by its beauty as always... Great Place to be for a family hangout or picnic...
40,Tajmahal,Lives up to the hype!,Beautiful and majestic. The artistic attention to detail is unbelievable! Summer was probably not the best time to visit though. The crowds were enormous and the staff did a good job managing the crowd. Make sure to get a guide and ask them to show the stones and marble with their flashlight..it's really beautiful.
40,Tajmahal,A bucket list must!,"The photos will not prepare you for your Taj Mahal experience. This is truly the jewel of India. If visiting the Taj, we encourage you to read as much as you can before visiting. Also, hiring a tour guide will be the best investment you can make. We learned so much from our guide."
50,Tajmahal,Awesomeee,Its just wow. Visited with my wife and just fell in love with her again. Each and every part of the Taj is just awesome and speaks what love is.
50,Tajmahal,Stunning,We queued up at 5am for the gates opening at 5.30am. We got some lovely photos with hardly any tourists in the back ground. Within the space of an hour the place was very busy. Definitely worth a visit!
50,Tajmahal,Simply awesome,"It was my fourth visit, with office friends this time. Seems like it becomes more beautiful every time I visit the Taj and the camera never stops. This is indeed a wonder and a must visit"
50,Tajmahal,Cannot by bound with words,A true wonder. The first visit to this place will surely leave you speechless. Please keep enough time in hand & do not rush this one through.
50,Tajmahal,Terrific Taj..!!,"Taj Mahal is definitely the most beautiful and iconic structure that one will observe in India. It is truly the highlight of Agra...!! The monument is breathtaking beautiful and one of the most famous architectural constructions still standing which has originated during the reign of the Mughal empire. Made completely out of white marble the Taj Mahal is a completely unique structure, no wonder it is considered amongst the Wonders of the World. Being in the center of Agra, commuting to the Taj is very easy, and finding ones way could not have been easier with signage boards throughout the city guiding the way. Once your at the Taj Mahal ticket counter, you would also find Electric Shuttles which would take you to the Taj Mahal at a nominal charge.  *Note: 1)The Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays. 2)Visitors must carry their ID proofs/ Passports 3)Don't forget to collect your ""Shoe Covers"" from the Taj Mahal ticket counter.  Definitely a place you ought to see during your lifetime. It is certainly classifies as the quintessence of Beauty..!!"
50,Tajmahal,Facinating - need a guide,"It was really really hot to visit in July, but the lack of other tourists made it totally worth it. Had an amazing guide which I would highly recommend since he explained the intricate designs, little-known-facts and pulled the story together so we really knew what we were looking at."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing wonder,"This place is very romantic, was a dream to visit the taj, its lovely, fantastic place but the only drawback is I feel/think the restoration process is not done appropriately"
50,Tajmahal,Breathtaking!,"No trip to India is complete without a visit to the grand Taj Mahal! A must see for all ages. It takes about 4-6 hours from Delhi (depending on driver/traffic) I used Agra Day Tours and hired a private driver ( can't remember price but well worth it for comfort and security) also, hire a guide! You will enjoy the tour and learn more this way!"
50,Tajmahal,Wonder of the World,"Beautiful ! Be sure to hire a guide to really live the experience, there are certain things only they will be able to show you !"
50,Tajmahal,Architectural Marvel,"The Taj Mahal is a fantastic piece of architecture. The architecture work of this building is simply awesome. This monument in white marble is a testimony to the artistic skills of ancient India. We visited the monument on a bright sunny day. I was amazed to see the huge crowd in early hours of the day. Foot wear is not allowed inside the Taj complex. But if you cover your shoes with a shoe cover, you do not have to remove them to enter the complex. So, do remember to buy a shoe cover."
50,Tajmahal,Lives up to the hype!,"The Taj Mahal undoubtedly lives up to the hype. It's so beautiful, especially if you go early in the morning! Anytime before 7am is so much quieter and easier for pictures.  I would carve out 2 hours or so to explore, have your little photo shoot and maybe check out the museum. The grounds are well kept, and the building itself is as cool as you'd think it would be.  Be careful of scammers and be sure to get your ticket at the ticket centre 2km up from the south gate before you go in! Be warned - the Indian local price is 20RP while tourists are 1000RP."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing!,"Not too much to say really, it's amazing.  Foreigner tickets cost R1000 which includes a small bottle of water and shoe covers. I went in the supposed low season during the summer but on a Saturday and the crowds were big but not a major hassle."
50,Tajmahal,Mesmerizing even after 10+ visits,Easily among the best tourist attractions in the World. I visited 10+ times during my 3 year posting at Agra and always enjoyed taking snaps from different angles and admiring the beauty.
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal Symbol of Love,Always my dream to visit this beautiful monument of love. So the ticket for foreigners will be INR 1500 per pax. You will be given bottle of water and show water. The monuments close to public at 5pm every day and Fri it's closed.
50,Tajmahal,The highlight of any visit to India!,"If you're looking for a guide, keep an eye out for Fasi Uddin. He's excellent. His English is not top notch, but he makes up for it in lots of other ways. He's the oldest guide working the Taj (in his mid-70s), was very knowledgeable (he's been working there since his teens) and reasonably priced. He added to our enjoyment of this fascinating and beautiful place."
50,Tajmahal,Symbol Of Love...!!! MUST VISIT,"This is a place which is worth watching in Agra special during Full Moon night. This monument had made India proud every time. Go with you love, family, friends.  Suggestion & Request- Do not litter"
50,Tajmahal,2 hour tour that i will never forget,"i did a tour with a guy called Shubham Pandey he charges 300 local indian currency. he was great tour guide, he has great knowledge of the place. if you have a camera he will take great pictures for you.. make sure to take your sun glasses, he will take this really cool picture to use on your social media website.. his number +91-9756205208"
50,Tajmahal,You have to go see it once,"What is a trip to India without seeing the Taj Mahal. Its a lot smaller than one would think beautiful up close all the work on the marble, expect your tour guide to want to take you to some overpriced shop that sells marble and things you can find elsewhere for a lot less.  I went late afternoon - no lines and missed the midday heat. Got to see things at sunset and it was a perfect time."
50,Tajmahal,Breath taking!,"The Taj Mahal is just stunning! The work and detail of the building is extremely impressive. I feel so grateful to say I have seen such a magnificent and historical structure.  When we visited it was a beautiful sunny day and was quite busy but the crowd just added to the atmosphere! There was plenty of time for us to walk around the grounds and into the Taj itself. There are plenty of wonderful picture opportunities but as lovey as the pictures are, it doesn’t justify how beautiful it is in real life.  You cannot go to India and miss seeing the Taj. The history and architecture is just incredible. I have travelled to many places around the world and this is one of the top attractions I recommended visiting."
50,Tajmahal,Fabulous,No words to say. Few feelings can't be put in words. Feast for my eyes.Visual wonder ! Visited on 18/07/2016.
50,Tajmahal,so not a cliche,what a wonderful wonderful site - seen in so many photos but completely different in 3 dimensions and within loads of chattering Indian tourists posing away..........wear mirrored sunglasses - it makes for a great selfie!
50,Tajmahal,Lovers' Heaven on Earth,"Visited during the month of November. First we went to Mehtab Bagh and viewed the Taj from the other side of the river Yamuna. Mehtab Bagh though not much right now is being developed. It provides a real viewing garden feel even in the ruined state that it is in. Then, the same night, we went for a night viewing of the Taj at 12 midnight. As we entered from the Eastern Gate we could see the Taj's main dome like a night blue onion which was incredibly uplifting. The half hour given to us at night was so powerful that all night we were seeing the night blue Taj with eyes open or closed. This image was still itched in our hearts when we reached at 6:30 am the next morning to view the Taj during sunrise. This was a completely refreshing experience, so different in terms of the changing colour palate of the Taj but so similar in terms of the over-powering impact of the Taj's image on our minds. We saw the Taj almost covered with fog, then slowly turning pink during the sun's rising, then white as the fog lifted with the growing daylight and finally almost yellow as the sun bathed it in its light. Everybody should visit to feel the beauty and love that there is in this world. Made our day and still the image lingers in our minds to bring back those refreshing memories.  Tip: Night viewing tickets are available at the office of the Archaeological Survey of India, Agra Circle, 22, The Mall, Agra. Visit during nights is allowed only two nights prior to full moon, full moon night and two nights after full moon. Also keep in mind that the tickets for tomorrow will be available today and they might get sold by as early as 12 noon, as there are many agents doing bulk bookings. So plan your trip accordingly. There is a form to be filled here so be ready pen in hand and determination in mind to stand in a line and get the night view of this love monument."
50,Tajmahal,Symbol of Love,"Architecture Marvel... Superb and fantastic. Go there and just take a look at it, mind blowing! Weather is an important phenomenon to visit Taj.. Try and go in Winters otherwise the heated marble will make it impossible to walk. Take a look at the Yamuna behind (although when I visited there was very less water)."
50,Tajmahal,One of the worlds most fantastic things to see,"I have been here twice . Both times were awesome . The building , the crowd , the history . All,breathtaking . You cannot go to India and not visit the Taj .I have travelled much of the world and this is the top two or three attractions that must be visited ."
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj!,"Recently visited Taj in the month of july.. though the temp was very hot and humid then too our enthusiasm didn't go down and we really enjoyed our visit. No wonder why it is called as one of the 7 wonders of the world.. the moment you enter the premises of Taj you will feel really different. No matter hw many times you see Taj, you will want to come back and see again.  We hired a guide which costed us Rs 500.. he was with us for 2 hrs and explained us many things which were really informative..  We didnt plan to hire a photographer.. but when photographer clicked our shots they were so nice that we tempted to take album.. he clicked 70 photos.. developed 60(5X8 size) out of them and given in an album plus one 8X12 photo and a dvd.. it costed 3000Rs.. not sure if its too costly but then memories are worth it...so its up to you to hire photographer. ..  Food and eatables are not allowed inside the premises. Free locker services are provided nearby ticket counter so that u can keep the same in case you take any eatables. Also please do carry your photo id as it is checked in ticket counter and also when you enter Taj.  All n all really good visit to Taj...do hire guide!!"
50,Tajmahal,"Beautiful, Tranquil and an absolute must-do if you are in India","This review is long overdue. The four of us had a chance to visit the Taj using one of the weekend that we had for our work travel. The journey there was long because it included a 6 hours car ride to Agra. We didn't mind as the 6 hours gave us a lot more time to see India. We arrived at Agra around 5 pm on Saturday, had dinner to prepare for the early Sunday visit. Woke up at around 5:30 am, India's morning is as hot as night time so wear something that breathe - like linen. We were at the site by 6 am and was the 6th person on that line. The earlier you go, the better chance you will have to take picture with the beautiful Taj MINUS other tourists. Early in the morning where everything was still quiet, the place was very tranquil and it gave us a bit of quiet time for self-reflection - we saw some meditation that went on as well. India is beautiful and Taj Mahal is absolutely stunning"
50,Tajmahal,It's a Lovely Place,Must Must Must Visit Taj Mahal if you are a true traveller. It's a symbol of love. Keep at least 2-3 hours to see it.
50,Tajmahal,"Not much to say, it's the TAJ MAHAL!","Everyone knows what to expect and that it's a must see.  I will however let those people planning a trip in the next year or two know that they're currently in the process of cleaning the minarets. This doesn't seem to be published online, or at least not extensively, I only found out about it two weeks prior to my trip after my mother mentioned the pictures of the Royal Couple there. I would assume they'll also be cleaning the main structure, so you've been warned... It however is just as breathtaking regard of the obstructions."
50,Tajmahal,"On everyone's bucket list or yes, worth seeing","You've seen it in the movies, you've seen pictures of it. It sheer size will surprise you. Ladies, do ask your husbands what they have done for you lately !"
50,Tajmahal,A site to see,It was amazing. Although very hot and crowded. If in the area you must go. The beautiful marble work and detail is amazing
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal - Symbol of Love,Beautiful view!! Iconic monument!! It was a pleasure to view the beautiful Taj Mahal. It was my first visit to Taj Mahal. It is purely amazing. We booked our trave through Bonzo Travels and stayed at Four Point Sheraton and our entire trip was just amazing after visiting Taj Mahal!!
50,Tajmahal,Feel the love at symbol of love - Taj Mahal,"There are 2 gates that lead you to Taj Mahal: - Western Gate: doesn't have parking space. If you are using public transport to visit Taj Mahal, this is ideal - Easten Gate: For those who need parking to park their vehicles. Parking charges were Rs 80.  Ticket Counter: You need to buy tickets to Taj Mahal. For Indian adults it is Rs. 40 per person. There are no charges for Kids 0-15 years. You need to show ID proof to obtain tickets (PAN is not acceptable as ID proof.  Timing: From sunrise to sunset. The ticket counter closes at 6 p.m. However, night visit to Taj Mahal is possible starting 2 nights before full moon night and two nights after that. You need special permission for that.  Reaching Taj Mahal: From Ticket Counter to main gate of Taj Mahal, the distance is around 2 kms. You can walk it up. But i suggest not to and reserve all your energy for the beautiful monument you have come to visit. You can take a horse carriage, battery operated vehicle or mini buses @ Rs. 10 per person (even for kids). You are not allowed to take any eatables inside the premise. All eatables are thrown in dustbin then and there. You can (and should) carry water bottles.  Taj Mahal: It is a beautiful monument made up of ivory white marble. it is one of the 7 wonders of the world, hence hugely popular and crowded. You are suppose to remove shoes to visit the main tomb. For Rs. 10 each you can get a pair of shoe covers and then need not remove shoes.  Why it is a Wonder: It is magnificently beautiful. You will feel love there. The monument was built by Shah Jahan (ofcourse not literally) in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is characterized with beautiful architechture. It is breadthtakingly marvelous. Must visit.... This was my third visit and i again fell in love with the place."
50,Tajmahal,One of the places to go before you die,"What more can you say about the Taj Mahal. It's one of the most impressive monuments in the world, and an unforgettable experience. Just get there early!"
50,Tajmahal,One day trip from Delhi,Gatimaan express is superb. Maintains the timing properly. Ola made life simple once we were in Agra cant. railway station. Got a driver there who served as guide too and made the journey really memorable. He's a Bhagwadgita scholar and explains things with so much reality with present times. His cab along with him can be hired for a day for Taj Mahal to Fatehpur sikri at very economic rate @ Bharat - 9557833712
50,Tajmahal,A Must visit place,A must visit place. Very well maintained.  Yamuna river at the back side can do with some beautification and cleaning.
50,Tajmahal,Great place,Of course it is a great place. Just a little bit too crowded watch out for the sellers because they will try insistently to sell you anything.
50,Tajmahal,Monument of Love!,"One of The New Seven Wonders of The World and synonymous of love. The beauty of this magnificent monument is such that is beyond the scope of words.the best time to visit is at sunrise, and sunset as the light changes.Night viewing is available on a full moon and limited to 30 minutes."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing majestic beauty amongst a dirty filthy city,"Loved the taj mahal. It definety lived up to all the expectations. So beautiful. We went around 6.30am and went to east gate. No cues got tickets straight away. You get bottle of water, shoe slippers and shuttle bus with the foreign entry ticket. Only annoying thing is touts in the park taking photos and rushing everybody else along saying it's a vip spot."
50,Tajmahal,Wah taj,Went to see Taj Mahal after almost 23 yrs. Got mad with the architecture and hardships with which this monument has been built.
50,Tajmahal,Must go,"It is huge and very crowded if you go during the day time or peak hours. I wish to go there early morning on my next visit in the future. It is definitely not hyped and is truly beautiful made of marbles. It makes you wonder how such effort have been put up to please someone in history, although this monument was created on the expense of public money (as told by locals), by the then king and brought recession to the city at that era, the whole tragic story seems burried under the white glowing piece of marble and the only thing the world remembers is the love. Amazing thing to witness."
50,Tajmahal,Family recreation,"Taj has is its own majestic look , no other beauty can be anything bigger or brighter then our TAJ White marble with its look has its own glory and shine"
50,Tajmahal,There's no mistake,"There's no mistake if Taj Mahal is one of seven wonders of the world. The beauty of Taj Mahal itself is fascinating me or all of you who have been there. The story of construction Taj Mahal is very historic and spread all over the world. In Taj Mahal you should take off your shoes or you could use shoes cover to keep Taj Mahal clean. You aren't allow to uncase flag, make noise, bring foods, etc. In the right and left Taj Mahal those are mosque and in the behind it you can see Yamuna River."
50,Tajmahal,India's gift to the world,"Truly stunning! I am speechless. Go with a tour guide reognized by the goverment, if you can. The experience is greatly enhanced by a guide who truly understands the history, majesty and cultural value this monument, and site. For more historical context of the Taj, visit the Red Fort and the Fatehpur Sikri."
50,Tajmahal,Final stage of Himalayan trek.,"This place is amazing.well kept gardens spotlessly clean. When going upto the taj paper slippers have to be worn over your own,no photos in the taj allowed. Get there early.it gets really hot. It's hard to imagine the love that's gone into building this place and the years it took. Do not miss this off your list when visiting India."
50,Tajmahal,Not overrated,Taj Mahal lives up to high expectations and is well worth the praise it receives. Definitely hire a guide. The crowds can be overwhelming so avoid weekends.
50,Tajmahal,Iconic,"A must see. The Taj is very beautiful and despite being crowded, a real highlight of our trip to India. There are lots of street hawkers outside and even the photographers will try and over charge for their services, so providing you are happy to ignore all the chaos, you'll really enjoy it. We enjoyed having our ""Princess Di"" moment on the stone benches with the stunning Taj in the background - a must for all tourists. Take paper shoes with you as you'll have to wear them when you walk around certain sections. The grounds are also lovely so take a camera and enjoy."
50,Tajmahal,Beautiful,This was my first visit to the Taj Mahal and I and I now understand what all the fuss is about. For sure a wonder of the world and a most romantic place that should be shared with a loved one. Worth paying the extra to watch the sun rise and the markets outside are a must
50,Tajmahal,Shiva Art Studio- Taj Mahal Pre-Wedding Photography,"Shiva Art Studio- True artist, professional, trust worthy, reliable, friendly, compassionate.  (I apologize, this review is a little late, but as I sit in my new home, in the living room as a newly married woman, on my walls and my TV stand my husband and I have yet to display any wedding pics but rather we have decided to display our pics from our engagement photo shoot taken by @Shiva Art Studio and @Devjeet Agarwal)  My husband and I were visiting India from the US for only two weeks, which included touring and WEDDING SHOPPING, and to top it off only in Delhi for two days. Brides… can you imagine my stress? The schedule was jam packed, no room for errors. I had dozens of emails back and forth with Devjeet Agarwal. He answered EVERY question; maybe even twice as I was that crazy bride that wanted to make sure EVERYTHING was perfect. Never did he sound annoyed or rude. He was very understanding and took the time to email me on my schedule despite our time zone difference. I searched and searched the web to find a photographer that would able to do our engagement photo shoot at the Taj Mahal, on that ONE day that we would be there, (Nov 15th 2015), for a decent price. Shiva Art Studio did not have many reviews but we went out on a limb and booked them. They did not take any money upfront. Everything was booked via email, so I was even worried that they wouldn’t show up! We had a phone number + a language barrier. I speak NO Hindi and English is their second language. When we met Devjeet and his father at the Taj Mahal that morning, and finished off our photo shoot by late noon, we knew we found a diamond in the rough. This was one of the BEST decisions we made throughout wedding planning. They were kind, the were professional, they were fast and the QUALITY- at the end that is what you want to see, right.. AMAZING! For foreigners booking- no need to worry, they held our bag with passports and all our travel money, they kept it safe, kept hagglers away and made us feel like VIP movie stars. Seriously, consider this, two AMERICAN’s at the Taj Mahal, dressed up in a suit and saree, who don’t speak an ounce of Hindi... its like we were asking to be preyed on by the numerous begging people and tour guides and instant photographers. Honestly, if it wasn’t for Devjeet and his dad, I think we would have seen the Taj Mahal from the parking lot and ran back to the car. They made us feel so safe, no only were they our photographers but our personal bodyguards and translators as well. Both father and son were easy to work with and were happy to work with us.  On April 29th 2016, we blew up our pictures, 30 x 30 canvas to display our Taj Mahal Engagement photoshoot during our wedding, we used the pictures for our thank you cards AND our wedding sign in book was an album of all the pics with space for our guests to write their well wishes. I used the pics everywhere I could because they were that awesome!  All my family was asking who took the pics, how did you find them and when I tell them the whole entire ordeal, they are all so impressed and say that we were so lucky to find such HONEST people who didn’t just try to take our money being that we were Americans. Not sure if it was luck, or going with your gut or being that crazy bride and doing your research, but whatever it was we were completely satisfied with the entire experience.  Even before I met my groom, the love of my life, I had already dreamt to have my engagement photo shoot at the Taj Mahal. @Shiva Art Studio made my dream come true!"
50,Tajmahal,7 Wonders of the World,"A must see if your collecting to see all seven wonders, its definitely worth a trip to appreciate what you have in life."
50,Tajmahal,loved it,"the taj is certainly the best India has to offer,we loved the taj in the rains as it was drizzling when we visited it ,lots of tourist and our guide told us all the stories,it is a wonderful placve."
50,Tajmahal,Masterpiece,"Unmistakably the best mausoleum and minarets that I have seen, symbol of eternal love. The experience one has is so good, when you actually get there and see this masterpiece in person. You do not actually get a scale of the structure until and unless you are actually there. This place is well connected to Delhi. A must see if you happen to be in North India, highly recommended."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing expression of love.,The wonderful monument to love is sadly dulled by the stark surroundings giving you a glimpse into history where the general population ekes out a meagre existence amid such lavishness.
50,Tajmahal,Awesome,The place to visit in agra !! We enjoyed it also under the rain. The ticket is not cheap but it is worth!!
50,Tajmahal,Best view and architecture,"This is my wow experience when explore Taj Mahal. Great architecture and view. My suggest, please don't bring the prohibited stuff like tripod, laptop, and foods. Because the locker rooms is 1 km from the gate. It happens to me and it's wasting time. Take the time by sitting on the garden with the view of Taj Mahal."
50,Tajmahal,visit to land of love,"This was an excellent tour! Our tour guide was extremely knowledgeable and took great care of my group. He brought us around to the best photo spots and was very patient as each person wanted a few snapshots with the Taj Mahal in the back. He provided a wonderful account of the history, and we were also able to bypass all of the lines. The driver was very good as well and ensured we were picked up and dropped back off at our hotel safely. It is a spectacular day, and I highly recommend this tour if you plan on seeing the Taj Mahal."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing place,"The Taj Mahal is well worth a visit if close to Agra. Bit of advice, you may need a guide when going round but negotiate as they will try to charge nearly 2000 ruppees when most will take you round for 600 ruppees. Also, if offered photographers then unless you don't have a camera then expect to pay 2000ish for 40 pics on a cd. Other than that there are some cool rooftop bars over looking the taj from nearby so worth going for a drink after walking around."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing sight!,"Such an amazing monument with a beautiful love story behind it. I would recommend going for the sunrise, this beats the large crowds and the heat if you go in summer (We went in June and Agra was SO hot!). The grounds are impeccable and its a lovely way to start the day. The detail and work that has gone into creating something so grand is incredibly impressive and it has been well maintained. We drove from Delhi which was a good 4-5hrs. Our driver picked up a tour guide on the way to show us around, he was very informative however he did insist we go to the marble factory, which although there were some impressive work, it was WAY overpriced."
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj,The most amazing beauty you could ever imagine. It's a must and gives you one in life time experience. Get a guide for ₹200 and he can take you in and out while explaining the beauty and architecture of the monument. You may get harassed by photographers. Don't forget to take your own camera or smart phone. Note: No food is allowed inside except water.
50,Tajmahal,Taj mahal,Fascinating india in its fullest! Worth to go there despite its so crowded there! Book tickets in advance if possible! Security is very strict.
50,Tajmahal,Takes my breath away every time,"I've seen it many times during my life, but it never disappoints. As soon as you turn into the entrance, and see it standing before you, your mouth drops and you gaze at it in amazement. My teenage boys were awe struck. It was really, really hot but not crowded, the benefit of traveling during the summer. We didn't have to wait to get inside or take our pic on Princess Diana's bench. Roads leading to the wonder are horrible, it's actually embarrassing that the country, my country, keeps it is such disrepair. Almost insulting when the TM existence has given so much for India's tourism. Please don't take it for granted. If it weren't a 1000 rupees to get in, I would have come back for the sunset, then again for the sunrise..."
50,Tajmahal,Beautiful and serene experience,"The monument is everything we hoped for. The lavish white stone structure was very exciting to explore, which we could do well because of the audio guide. The audio guide is very cheap and available to hire. One must take the guide. And do carry your own water!"
50,Tajmahal,"The Taj, Mausoleum For Mumtaz Mahal","The Taj, Mausoleum For Mumtaz Mahal was built by then emperor Shah Jahan. It took decades to build this marvelous property which is now a world Heritage Site! Its made from white marble and surrounded by lush green and well maintained gardens. THere are two other structures besides the Taj mahal. One is a Mosque and Other is A Hindu Temple. Its situated in the banks of Yamuna River. One can easily access Taj mahal from South Gate East Gate or West Gate. The Entry to Taj Mahal Compound is from a bigger Gate.This gate way is an octagonal entrance hall, surrounded by small rooms on both the sides, and has ornamented gates on two sides, one opening towards the court yard and the other to wards the Taj. The Gateway is a master piece in itself. People Ususlly go to Agra on a day visit or weekend plan. The drive from Delhi is 2 hrs 30 mins via Yamuna Expressway."
50,Tajmahal,amazing experiaence,"View of tajmahal was amazing....but in summer, one should visit the tajmahal in early morning 5:30 to 6 AM...."
50,Tajmahal,Quick trip to the Taj Mahal,"Inspite of the oppressing humidity, it was well worth a visit to this great monument. Sadly, everything surrounding the entry to this great place is either in disrepair, being repaired or in a very messy condition. Once you get past the horrible entry process, the hoardes of tourist guides pouncing on you and the hoardes of trinket sellers and a handful of beggars, it's all worth it."
50,Tajmahal,"Incredible, just unbelievably incredible!","What a way to culminate an adventure of trying to get to half way around the world by plane, car, bus, and rickshaw. The Taj is truly incredible.  Only two other times in my life have I seen something in person this impressive in Machu Picchu and Igazu Falls but both of these are on a different scale and type. Pictures just don't do the Taj justice.  I followed the advice of the rickshaw driver and went at 5:30am for sunrise. So glad I did as it was getting very warm by 6:30am, crowds were really really light, and pictures in early morning light were much better. Still made it back to hotel in time for breakfast.  Two of the minarets have scaffolding for cleaning and entrance road is under significant reconstruction."
50,Tajmahal,Doesn't disappoint:,"The highlight of our trip to India. Sometimes with these large monuments or attractions they are a bit of a let down as they don't live up to the hype or the pictures you've seen online before you arrive. Not the case with the Taj Mahal, this is just one of the most spectacular sights I've ever seen. We visited one afternoon and again the following morning at sunrise. Couldn't recommend this enough. You won't be disappointed."
50,Tajmahal,A must on the bucket list!,A beautiful man-made wonder. Overwhelmingly romantic and peaceful at the same time. Hire a good guide (avoid pushy ones) and you will have a great time.
50,Tajmahal,Beautiful!,"Awesome place, now I understand why is one of the 7 wonders of the modern world! Only bad point, they charge us 1000 instead of 750 Rs. Seems they have increased the entrace price, a bit expensive to be in India but worthy!"
50,Tajmahal,Words cannot describe it,This is one of those rare places that you need to visit because a written description is not fully just to the feeling one experiences first hand. I hope you get the chance to see this beauty.
50,Tajmahal,Historical place,It's a very beautiful place to see in Agra with whole family and it's a enjoyable and education tour both
50,Tajmahal,Just Go before you die,"at the very first second that I saw it , it just a breath taking. It is just something you need to see with your eyes before you die. The marble and every details is just unique and mavelous. Abosolutely beatiful. Just go for christ sake you wont regret."
50,Tajmahal,marvelous engineering,Its a very beautiful architect i have ever been into. Try to visit in the morning as it would be cool and less no of people. Seeing Taj Mahal in the morning is breathtaking . don't forget to take lots of photograph and take a guide to understand the history behind the monument.
50,Tajmahal,Awesum-Awesum-Awesum,"Agra is my native too but this review is not because of my native place but its about worth place to visit. View from backside where yamuna flows is awe sum, someone should visit in monsoon that time water flows very quickly and view will be magnificent."
50,Tajmahal,One of the modern day marvels of the world... a must see if you visit Delhi,"What can I say about the Taj, this is one of the most recognized buildings in the world so you already know the basics. I was lucky enough to visit with a friend that hired a guide, I don't know how much he got paid but i would recommend getting one.  There is a small area (like a hall) before entering the Taj, there is a big door where you can see the Taj. The guide asked me to stand on a specific tile where I could see the entire Taj. He then asked me to move exactly two tiles to my right and i could see half of the Taj, two more tiles would allow me to see a quarter of the building. He told me that the symmetry of the Taj was verified using this method (no theodolites 500 years ago). This was very cool I should have taken my camera and took pictures of this symmetry.  Since it is a sacred Muslim place you have to take off your shoes. Women should wear socks (or bring them) if you want to avoid bare foots.  Don't expect a big visitor center where you can buy souvenirs; yes, there are many local vendors and they are persistent but they are respectful too. The more you talk to them the more they will try to sell you whatever they are selling. A firm (and gentle) No thanks will be enough, but it will work better to come from a male (just the facts)."
50,Tajmahal,"Taj Mahal, the must visit place in Agra","The Taj Mahal, is the place you will find lot of crowd , it better to visit on weekday and avoid on Friday."
50,Tajmahal,Beautiful monument,Taj Mahal is a must-see. But it is often way too crowded & many parts inside the monument are not clean enough. It is beautiful to see from outside and the gardens are to walk around. Must see at least once.
50,Tajmahal,Fantastic,We spent two days in Agra and the 'Taj' was the highlight of our trip to India. Fantastic. It looks even better in real. This is a photographers delight. Make sure to bring your camera along with you as this is definitely a once in a lifetime experience. Hire a guide in advance as it is chaotic at the entrance and a local guide helps in ushering you in as soon as possible away from hawkers. There are no words to describe the beauty of the Taj Mahal. It is truly a wonder.
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj!,"It was my second visit to the Taj. I would suggest to tourists to take the audio book. You have to pay at the counter from where the buses leave for the Taj. It is worth it. It is around Rs 100/- for English, and Rs 70/- for Hindi. It is also available in Bangla. It will take at least and hour and half to go though the entire place. We hired the services of a professional photographer. He charged Rs 50/- per photo. He gave us the print outs and CD (additional cost) by the time we were thru with our sight seeing. I think it was worth it! There is nothing new that I can add to the beauty of the Taj. It is a must for everyone's bucket list."
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal visit in 2016,"I fulfilled a promise to my wife after 32 years of marriage!!! When we got married in 1984, I promised her that I would take her to see the Taj Mahal - it fruitified in 2016. The Taj Mahal is definitely worth a visit - forget what people say about the pollution and the dirt. If you have a love for history, you will love this place as it has so much history and love attached to it. We were surprised at how easy it was to get in at dawn and had ample time to take out photographs and view the Taj Mahal by dawn in absolute leisure without the rushing crowds that are mentioned in so many review. It is absolutely true - the view by moonlight and by daybreak are two completely different experiences. All in all, the trip was absolutely worth it and I would recommend anyone who has not visited the Taj, to do so."
50,Tajmahal,Spectacular,"The Taj Mahal is truly spectacular and amazing, there isn't really much more that can be said. Try to avoid at weekends and go very early to avoid the crowds. It does get really busy."
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,This was amazing to see. It is a long way from Delhi though. Take about 3 hours in a car to get there. We hired a driver for I think around $70. We tipped about the same. We had a good driver and the trip there was fun to see. There are brick factories and small farms and houses made of cow dung. I would do the same trip again.
50,Tajmahal,Stunning,"Words can't describe the sight of the Taj Mahal. Exploring the rest of the complex was an eye-opener. I hadn't realised that the mausoleum is just a part, albeit a spectacular part, of the whole complex.  Visiting in the heat of summer was the only downside."
50,Tajmahal,Wonder of the world...,"Went there in April 2016. Good place to visit. Though it gets too hot in April itself, but the beauty of Taj remains unparalleled. Its best to visit Taj in evening, because there is no covered place in Taj area, so all the sunlight and sun-heat falls directly on the head. Be respectful of the place being a mausoleum, because the locals would not like you doing anything disrespectful in the Taj area.  The photographs with Taj in the background are simply the best in the world. But one sad part is that there are so many people waiting for the photographic places that you have to wait for those photos, for eg. where you sit on the marble bench in front of Taj, etc."
50,Tajmahal,Lovely place for eat,"We ate in treat restaurant a couple of times, banana lassis and fresh mango juice are a must! The place is small but full of atmosphere and friendly conversation. Authentic food cooked very well no matter what the cuisine. No frills, delicious food at a great prices."
50,Tajmahal,Wonder of the world,Nothing is as beautiful as Taj in this planet. Life time experience. you can not ask for more. Great art work of ancient time.
50,Tajmahal,Majestic Taj,"The restoration work is almost done and the Minars are sparkling white. Enjoyed every bit, including a horse carriage ride on the new red stone Road being laid out. The infrastructure around the monument is improving. Never a dull moment. Do not miss the optical illusion at the entry gate, ask for the guide to explain."
50,Tajmahal,Mesmerizing Taajmahal,When I entered from West gate I mesmerised by the first view of Taajmahal. I don't believe something that is made by human is that much much beautiful. Really you need to visit this site. It's truly magnificent.
50,Tajmahal,""" Beauty to watch on full Moon Day""",""" As the place is always very crowded & climate was humid in summer, So its advisable to visit early morning before 8 am. All the indian citizen should carry photo ID (Pan Card not acceptable as ID proof), its better to take a guard, Guard will cost you INR 200 to 300."
50,Tajmahal,No Words!!,"It was a life time achievement, got goosebumps at first sight. What an architecture.  ""For 22 years more than 20,000 workmen were forced to build the Taj. The Maharaja of Jaipur sent the marble as a gift to Shah Jahan. The building and its surroundings cost more than $200,000,000 in todays currency."""
50,Tajmahal,Perfect if you get the timing right,"What an absolutely amazing place, the Taj Mahal is! It was even better than I thought. I have heard people say the front is amazing whereas at the back it's not as interesting and the views are rubbish, but in turns out this was not so. It is spectacular from any angle. Now I should stress now that my friend and I were lucky with the weather (it poured down two hours after we left) and we got the timing right: our entry tickets show that we purchased them at 06:40 and this was spot on: it was not appallingly busy neither, this being July, was it appallingly hot, whereas it was starting to get hot by the time we left at 10:00 or so. This enabled us to appreciate the beauty of the complex, which doesn't look bad from any angle. Obviously, everyone is going to take a picture from the front, but do go around to the back as well because it's also a beautiful view of the Yamuna river. Maybe I'm biased because I was here just at the start of the monsoon season so it was greener than it otherwise would be, but it was still a very pretty view.  Tips: Go early in the morning as I have mentioned As a tourist, if you buy your ticket for Rs 1000 from a building which advertises itself as a restaurant and bar at the Eastern Gate, included in the price is a bottle of water, shoe covers and a free ride in a golf cart to the main gate, meaning you can avoid the rickshaw bicycle people trying to flog you a bike ride. Or just walk, it's less than a kilometre. Do not get a bicycle ride to the gate: it's 750m at best and you'll be ridiculously overcharged for having someone cycle you there. When inside, if you want to do the obligatory Taj reflecting in the pool photo, point your camera slightly down towards the water and turn off the flash, that way you will get the strongest image of the building.  Otherwise, enjoy the majesty of this building. It is truly special."
50,Tajmahal,What a BEAUTIFUL gesture of love,I cannot believe a structure built centuries ago can still be this magnificent. What a BEAUTIFUL gesture of showing his love for his lady - kudos Shahjahan.
50,Tajmahal,Stunning,Definitely a place to make time to go - stunning! Even when stuck in the middle of torrential downpours
40,Tajmahal,Simply superb ....,Why I rated this one .... not excellent. . Only good .. poor maintenance ... earned lot out of this .. nearly lakhs and lakhs .. but I have see broken stones kept inside .. It last it's beauty now .. stone turned in brown in color .. not all area in visible position. . Water bottles .. shoes covers spread then and there .. I feel unhappy with this .. very good monument ...but soon it will ..
40,Tajmahal,Impossible to skip,"If you are in India it is mandatory to visit Taj Mahal! We enjoyed our visit and meeting a lot of curious indian families that wanted to take pictures with us.  Price is 1000 Indian rupies for foreigners, which although Taj Mahal is amazing, we found expensive."
40,Tajmahal,Mesmerized!,"The 8 hour trip (2-way) from New Delhi to Agra didn't matter at all. The Taj Mahal takes you back to an exhilarating, beautiful past right before your eyes. The best part, the crowd was minimal so the experience was never rushed. Just try to be more keen on photographers who offer taking photos as their rates could change from what was initially agreed."
40,Tajmahal,Spellbound by your beauty,"They call it the symbol of love. I would say its a symbol of hard work, great vision and dedication which holds the Taj Mahal in front of us. To view the precision and detailed work with marbles and semi precious stone is a priceless experience. I would say there is no greater monument in India than this."
40,Tajmahal,More magnificent in person,"What can you say about the Taj that hasn't already been said? The trip from Canada to Agra is grueling, when you arrive you are tired and in shock if this is your first trip to India, then you step through the gates and see her in all her glory. The Taj is a beautiful sight and in my opinion worth the effort to visit."
40,Tajmahal,Via-Agra: Mans greatest erection for love,"We went in july which was truly a wrong time to go with kids as it is hot and humid. It is very beautiful and truly deserves to be a wonder of the world. September to March is supposed to be mush cooler and a full moon is supposed to be really wonderful. Be careful of restaurants, they will fleece you if you do not check the menu before ordering. The same with guides, always seal the price before and not after. You can bargain with the vendors outside as the first price they say is almost 10 times more."
40,Tajmahal,Majestic!,Just be careful with whom you deal wherever in India. Choose wisely who you engage business with and / or talk to.
40,Tajmahal,A Wonder of the World indeed,"Needs no introduction, as who doesn't know of the Taj Mahal. Only advice is to go when the weather is good and make sure you shell out the extra money to buy shoe covers. Walking on the hot marble barefoot is inviting injury and blisters. Do go in for the guided tour to know of all the wonderful history surrounding it."
40,Tajmahal,Impressive grounds and building,"Picked up tickets at 5:30 from the east gate ticket office then walked down taj east gate and was in just after 6am. Good idea to go early as the temperature is much cooler although it was still very busy (had been told it was much quieter in the mornings) so can only imagine what it's like later on. Impressive gardens, lots of tourists taking photos!! So hard to get a good snap without lots of people in the background with camera phones + selfie sticks out. Seems like some sort of illusion where the Taj Mahal seems a lot larger from a distance and the nearer you get it seems to shrink down in size, very intricate detail on the outside of the building which is nice to go up close too, the inside of the building is not so great as it's very dark and full of people talking. A must do to anyone visiting India/Agra though"
40,Tajmahal,It's beautiful architecture,"Overall was good but was spoilt somehow by agreeing to allow a photographer to follow. He just showed us some pictures and say it only cost 100rupee per picture so we thought it's ok for him to take some. But he follow us through and asked us to post for many (strange) positions and then told us 6000rupees for all pics with a cd. We had to ask him to go as he has ruined our opportunity to take with our own phones and camera. I only agree to buy 10pcs at 1000rupee and selected the pics from his camera (who keeps hard printed copies nowadays!) but he selected and printed more himself and we ended paying 1500 for 15. Some obviously strange post with my big fat leg on the bench is definitely not something I'll select but it ended up being printed :( Since its kinda like once in a lifetime visit for me and family to the Taj, we all wanted to take many many pics ourselves but this guy ruined the day (sorry to say, I know you are just doing your job). The guide (pre-arranged with Surya.dutt.narela@gmail.com) was good though, explaining and showing us the gem that will light up inside the mausoleum. Nice educational tour after all. At least checking off one of the 7wonders from my list :). Yes-as everyone else say, go early is really better to avoid crowd. We are there at about 6am and left before 8am to go back to hotel for breakfast. When we are walking out, you can see a long que at the ticket counter."
40,Tajmahal,Marvellous,We visited Taj on 3rd july'16. It is really a marvellous place to visit. Although it was very hot that time but one can not stop himself to take a glimpse of such beautiful wonder of World.
40,Tajmahal,Wah Taj!!!,"Use a guide, they are expensive.....they can show you the real beauty which can't be noticed otherwise."
40,Tajmahal,Interesting for all the family,"We didn't take a guide (we read alot before about) but a good guide can be a very good idea. Find a good one, official from the government and with a good English.  With small kids try to go at the end of the day.  Its a wonder who need to be see. Kids enjoyed"
40,Tajmahal,Superb outing to tajmahal,"Went to tajmahal on our anniversary for a long drive to delhi and had a great time. The place has its old charm and is lovely to see from everywhere. The nearer one goes, the better it gets. This place was built by emperor shahjahan in memory of his wife . It is one of the seven wonders of the world and feel proud of it as an indian"
40,Tajmahal,UNESCO World Heritage,No cars are allowed near the site. Electrical cars are available to ferry passengers from the parking to the main entrance. You are not allowed inside with your shoes on. Beware of touts and pick-pockets.
40,Tajmahal,"Serene, beautiful","Crowd management is good, appreciate the security measures. However, it is sad to see that despite written requests people use cameras and talk in area where the tombs are. I wish, the guards present would stop people from doing so."
40,Tajmahal,Symbol of LOVE !!!,"Its become business all over Agra..UP Govt to take care of TAJ as its nearby ares are dirty.Y do u take 25% tax on entry to taj...Strange..Atleast you should have some refreshment area where you get Water,....etc"
40,Tajmahal,"Wonderful gardens and birds, along with the famous building.","I loved being there. I spent a lot of time wandering the gardens, which are beautiful and beautifully maintained. I liked staying nearby so I could come before and after lunch at home."
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful structure with lots of nuisance around...,"Its really on of the wonder. But to see that beautiful structure you have to pass through lots of nuisance, like guide, hawker, narrow street, photographer... Actually I suggest to visit taj with Guide... but hire guide from inside of Taj compound only. Don't entertain any person who will stop your car 1 km before Taj and will give you false information about long que and parking problem... avoid such persons..."
40,Tajmahal,AWESOME!!,"when you view taj in books /magazines or TV and when you it own ..they are different.Really!! Didn't imagine before viewing that it would be so beautiful .After viewing taj u will just say .Wah Taj!!  Cleaniness of approach roads to Taj ,sanitation and water logging need to be adressed"
40,Tajmahal,Amaaazing...,"We have gone for Sunrise visit, and which was simply amazing. As we have visited in the non peak season we could see so much peacefully.  how can i say something about world wonder :) especially to a indian."
40,Tajmahal,Wah!!! Taj,"Taj Mahal beautifully surrounded buy greenery along the river the bank of yamuna. You can bring your own camera ,Best time to visit august-november."
40,Tajmahal,Really the wonder of world,Definitely a place to visit when in agra. Very clean and neatly kept. i also recommend hiring a guide as they do explain each things.
40,Tajmahal,impressive building but need improvement on the entrance,"Visited on early Jul, the weather is pretty hot. but the beautiful of the building is no questions. impress of the art works and design of the building. unfortunately, some cleaning work in progress on the 2 small building have some disappointment to us.  the taxi driver stop us at the parking area, and we were approach by the local tour guide and seller or all sort of offer. we managed to get a small cab which send us into the ticketing counter. at the ticketing counter, we were informed that foreign visitor with the high price ticket entitled a free tour guide. and we were given some free mineral water and shoe cover too. i'm not really sure if this is genuine from the local authority, but the tour guide is quite friendly and explain in quite well and also helping us take some beautiful photos. At the end of the tour, he bring us to the souvenirs shops, price is pretty expensive but they are not forcing us to buy. Before leaving, we did provide him some tips for he hard work.  overall, we are very much attracted to the history and the design of the building. nice photos taken with the building. and more improvement should be done for the access for the tourist be it local or foreigner at the entrance starting from the parking area."
40,Tajmahal,One more ticked off the bucket list,You walk through the gate and there is the Taj Mahal What an amazing view How amazing is the Taj mahal You realise how large it is when you see the relative size of the people to the temple The water in front was lovely and the grounds beautiful .
40,Tajmahal,Amond the Hordes,"Unsurprisingly one of the most crowded monuments I have ever visited - the sheer numbers of people were quite overwhelming. As a photographer, I try to spend as much of my time abroad making interesting pictures, so I did not have high hopes for getting a usable shot from the Taj. However, once I decided to photograph other tourists instead, I started having a lot more fun. People posing out of context is pretty hilarious. And I have to say, for the building itself - it is pretty damn impressive, and even if you hate tourist traps like I do, it's really something worth taking a day to visit for yourself."
40,Tajmahal,Awesome monument,"A must see monument in Agra, world famous structure built with marble, most of the visitors may not be knowing about one thing and that is, thete in NO lights in the whole Tajmahal complex. One can visit Tajmajal on fullmoon days with additional enterance fees that too in moon light, No ELECTRICITY."
40,Tajmahal,Obviously a wonder of the world,It was great to have a personal guide. Much more is learned and your eyes are opened to things you had no idea about. Glad I got to see it.
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful.,"One of the most beautiful place to visit in the world. Truly amazing! there is always a crowd there, avoid going in the summer as their's is very harsh. The guides are nice, the photographers are talented. Overall its a must see!!"
30,Tajmahal,Breathtaking but security is ridiculous!,I loved the Taj Mahal and it was exactly what I thought it would be. However I found it a frustrating experience due to the ridiculous security at the gates. We had a stroller and baby bag containing the necessities as we had a toddler and we couldn't take certain things in for her e.g. toys in case she needed distracting. Our tour guide was quite surprised too and this made me quite stressed which was a shame as I didn't enjoy it as much as I'd have liked to!
30,Tajmahal,Except Taj Mahal rest of the place is so dirty and filthy,"Visited Taj Mahal last week. It was raining on and off. Started from Delhi to Taj Mahal. Luckily our driver was very good.. Reached in 3.30 hrs. Cab driver stopped in the parking lot.. Plastic bottles and trash were there all over the place. Since it was raining we took a rickshaw to go to Taj Mahal. We were quite shocked to see garbage on our way to TM. My high hopes for seeing TM at this time dropped a bit.. We were stopped by some guide .. There was a huge queue( It was a weekend) . Guide said he would take care of us from standing in the long queue and make sure to keep people away from falling on us. As we entered, it started pouring.. So we had to rush to the red fort with our 2 kids and stay there until rain stops.. OMG ! Stench ! Urine smell .. UNBELIEVABLE ... Couldn't take the smell anymore. I would rather get my entire family wet .. So we choose to walk in the rain to TM. Certainly, TM is beautiful... but the approach and the people staring at you constantly and the filthy smell made is very unpleasant. My 9 yr old and 4 yr old said, I would never want to come back to TM again. I agree with them.. Enjoy TM from a book or online pics."
30,Tajmahal,Overpriced,"It costs 1000 rupees now! Disappointed that price has increased so much :-( That is something beautiful and amazing. Impossible to describe, but as always under construction and so many things is not allowed to do....."
30,Tajmahal,Beautiful!,Stunningly beautiful architecture and history. The day of my visit was rainy (no hard feelings to mother nature) and inside the tomb was very dark...couldn't really see anything. Kinda disappointing. Some low lighting inside for dark overcast days would be nice. We actually got better pictures across the river from the moonlight park. And no crowds. Visited in July 2016.
30,Tajmahal,Off my list,I visited a week ago and was my first time in India. Whilst I am pleased I have seen it I am not sure I would go back. It was a good 3 hour drive from Delhi and smaller than expected.  I would recommend to first time travellers to say you have seen it. But it was smaller than expected and would recommend getting there as early as possible to avoid the crowds.
30,Tajmahal,Great to see if you're in India but be ready for the crowds and humidity during summer!,"The building was beautiful and well maintained however the crowds are nuts here! Almost as crazy as disneyland so I highly suggest getting there right when they open at sunrise. Also if you go in July, be ready for the most *intense* humidity of your life! I have been in jungles that were less humid than this site. Don't forget bug spray!"
20,Tajmahal,Dissapointed and horrified,"I am so dissapointed to call myself an Indian after vsiting Agra and the taj mahal after many years of longing to do so. It is so poorly maintained,, there were paan spittings inside the taj (unbelivable). The city of agra is so undeveloped - its a shame. The path leading to the Taj mahal is broken roads with unkept lawns, there is so much they could have done considering this is a world heritage site. most people come to india just to visit the taj and i feel for them that they get such a nasty impression of us. Please maintain this beautiful monument properly."
10,Tajmahal,Overrated,Very overrated .. There are many other places better than this. If you still want to visit then don't visit in weekends. Entry ticket is Rs 40 for indian citizens and for Foreigners is Rs 800.
10,Tajmahal,Visit,"Taj is nice structure made by best architect. Everything is planned there, if taken care by administration this would be as it is for more hundred years."
45,Tajmahal,Simply breathtaking,"Everybody in India must have seen Taj Mahal in some way or other, in books, TV, magazines etc.. But visiting the place physically give the ocular pleasure which is incomparable. A must visit place in one's lifetime."
45,Tajmahal,Wah Taj,June is a bad time to visit Taj. Was searing hot. Inside of Taj felt like a sauna. Lot of renovation going on that obstructs the view. Inspite the architecture is a beauty every time you see it.
45,Tajmahal,Wonderful,"We went with our tour guide Nadeem, he got the tickets in advance and a photographer for a photo shooting. The place is beautiful but you have to arrive early in the morning before it gets crowded, good timing between 8 to 11 am, otherwise it gets really hot and more difficult to take good shots. You can't bring candies, chewing gum, food, only bottle of water, cameras and purse of descent size. If you have one day in agra 2 hours is more than enough to visit the Taj Mahal, and get the pictures in the best spots."
45,Tajmahal,Stunning!,"Expect lots of people from locals to foreigners, lots of photographers. Audio guides are available. The structure is just amazing and the carvings on the wall will show you how much hard work is alloted to build the Taj Mahal."
45,Tajmahal,Just breathtaking!,"I have always wanted to see the Taj and I managed to squeeze a day in to a business trip to see it. It took 4 1/2 hours to get there and similar time back.  However, when I saw it, it really was as magnificent as everyone says."
45,Tajmahal,A world wonder,"Even the long drive from Delhi, the traffic jams & the stifling heat could not detract from experiencing the wonder of the Taj Mahal. We were picked up by a private car at our hotel in Delhi & transported on the several hour journey to Agra. The countryside en route was very interesting. Once in Agra we found our guide & he ferried us to the East Gate entrance to the Taj. Spotlessly clean, this location is in stark contrast to the general condition of Indian urbanity. The courtyard leads us to the Wedding Gate which is magnificent in its own right. After taking the obligatory photos of the mausoleum from inside the Wedding Gate we walked through the gardens leading to it. All the while our guide provided commentary which served to enhance our experience. Finally walking around and inside the mausoleum we got to appreciate the workmanship that went into creating this marvel. It is incomprehensible to fully describe this location & I highly recommend anyone to visit it. The temperature in Summer is diabolical but seeing & experiencing the Taj was worth it."
45,Tajmahal,Amazing,The has to be one of the most incredible places in the world - very moving when you first catch sight of it and absolutely stunning to look at
45,Tajmahal,Great Taj Mahal Experience,"We visited it at 5:30 in the morning as per our guide instructions: it was not crowded, not to hot and we experienced the differnt colors of Taj as the sun was rising!"
45,Tajmahal,Love,One of my favourite place. After seeing tajmahal i got to understand why is it one of the seven wonders of the world.
45,Tajmahal,Absolutely worth it!,"Some will say that there's too much hype around the Taj Mahal, that you will have high expectations and be disappointed. Maybe, but that was certainly not the case for me. I found an excellent guide (through Kaimur Holidays - recommended!) and enjoyed every minute of my visit."
45,Tajmahal,symbol of love -Recaptured,"taj always a place to be visit, this summer(june) finally made plan to visit, though there were lots of contrary comments before trip especially due to hot summer, however plan made for which i dont have any regret, we started from Yamuna express way in the mid night to visit taj during sunrise, it is well maintained , garden are adding up the value of campus, monument is more beautiful as what it seem in picture, went in there inside."
45,Tajmahal,It's a wonder of the world.... Remember?,Saying something about The Taj Mahal is like shining a lamp to the sun. You have to see it to believe it. The less said the better...
45,Tajmahal,Symbol of love,Taj Mahal agra is very nice place and very nice architecture and design of Taj In Taj daina bench designed very much
45,Tajmahal,WOW! GREAT VIEW,"It was great seeing this monument. Although the restoration is work is on in a big way both inside and outside of the Taj, but still this Monument never fails to impress. Great place."
45,Tajmahal,love forever,Best example for lovers this tajmahal and very good feeling there love to go again and again . Love u taj
45,Tajmahal,You can dee why this is one of the 7 wonders of the modern world,"Early start after diving out of the Light House Hotel at 6am. Although I have seen dozens of pictures the real thing still takes your breath away. Our guide Anjum, was both knowledgeable and an enlightened spirit. The history and technicalities of building this matches the romance of its conception. If you can organise your visit then go for a night tour two days either side of the full moon. I won't say why this will be special because you will discover whenever you go."
45,Tajmahal,TREAT TO WATCH......,"The beauty which is seen by many and a dream for many to visit here, is real treat to watch... My desire to visit again remains as single visit is enough for exploring the place......"
45,Tajmahal,Amazing,Amazing place to visit specially early in the morning. The walls are all crafted and it is more beautiful as you get closer. So worth it!!
45,Tajmahal,The Jewel of India defiantly lives up to the hype.,"Our primary reason to detour to Agra for the day and we were not disappointed. A true awe inspiring experience to see the world wonder, which i’d recommend to anyone visiting India.  We purchased our ticket in advance from the south gate which was close by to our hotel ‘Sai Palace’ and ideal base for anyone wanting to visit the wonder. The entry price for foreigners was expensive but still well worth it to see one of the 7 wonders of the world. Remember to get your free shoes and bottle of water included in the price of the ticket.  An early morning visit highly recommended to avoid the crowds and heat of the midday sun. Make sure you get there before they open to beat cues. Also word to warning don’t try and bring any tripods or odd looking equipment into the site. I turned up with my gorilla pod which they didn’t like one bit as they didn’t know what the contraption was. I was annoyingly forced to store the item in there lockers which are a good 5 minutes away near the coach park.  Once you enter you will be in absolute awe of the place, it was truly beautiful a once in a lifetime experience. The clean white marble architecture and lush green colourful grounds were lovely to walk around. Be prepared to take a 1,000+ photos (The place is Very Picturesque). Even the scaffolding on the north east minaret didn’t spoil the wonder of the place.  An amazing monument and a must see. The true jewel of India defiantly lives up to the hype."
45,Tajmahal,Awesome and Breath taking Experience!!!,Agra is too HOT!!! in may june so i would not recommend anybody to go during summer but it was my excitement to go and visit Taj Mahal and finally my dream come true. No matter whatever the season is watching Taj Mahal is always breath taking experience to all. Love to see beauty of Taj and its incredible cravings. I still cant forget the best moments at Taj love it <3
45,Tajmahal,Worth to visit,"One should visit the taj mahal once. Excellent architecture... Recommended time to visit the place is early morning or late afternoon, as rest time its too hot to go out"
45,Tajmahal,Must See,Excellent place . Full of marble.Near from agra cantt railway station . Free of cost Socks are given .
45,Tajmahal,Embodiment of Love,I We get mixed feelings while inside this marvel. It's such an extravagant way of showing a person's love towards a deceased person. The sheer size of the building takes you by surprise.
45,Tajmahal,A Real Wonder of The World,No Words For This Place. Simply mangificent. A Guide will add worth to your visit. But visit the place in the rainy or winter season. It was too hot in June.
45,Tajmahal,Breathtaking! But the area is full of scammers,"The Taj is a MUST see whilst in Agra, Although for tourists it is pricey at 1000rs, you couldn't spend your money better anywhere else!  The indian gov. need to get a handle on all of the scammers in the area, trying to rip tourists off for their money.  The professional Photographers at the TAJ are worth the money, as this is a one in a life time opportunity. Same goes for the Guides! - However REMEMBER to HAGGLE the price by 40%! the photographer wanted 900rs for big photos on a disk, but i got him down to 560rs.  ENJOYS & REMEMBER TO BARTER"
45,Tajmahal,AMAZING,Price is a bit steep considering the lack of maintenence. So much rubbish and greenery has a bit more to be desired. However so beautiful and worth the visit. Amazing story behind the monument as well. So many people was disrespectful for the building though... taking photos where not suppose to and wearing shoes where it should be covered. Also try to avoid mid day. Too many people. We arrived around 5:30am but there were atleast 200 people already and its off season.
45,Tajmahal,must see!,"if you're hesitant about taking the long trip to see it, don't be. this place is a must see. not only does it have a nice story attached to it, the view and building architecture is breathtaking."
45,Tajmahal,Magical place,"Went at sunrise, was rather quiet then and not too hot so it was great! This is an amazing building, very inlressive architecture, there is something magical about it!  The museum had nothing soecial though but it isnincluded in the price of the Taj ticket so we went anyway."
45,Tajmahal,Must see!,"Absolutely gorgeous! A must see! Get there early. Be prepared to wait a while in the security line, but totally worth the wait!"
45,Tajmahal,Wonder that has stood the test of time,The Taj Mahal is by far the most beautiful building in India ever created. The exquisite marble mausoleum was commissioned as a testament of the love Shah Jahan had for his wife. One enters the complex through a courtyard that is if itself spectacular. Even the calligraphy on the arched doorway is amazing. The Taj marble dome is surrounded by four minarets which look like they are leaning away from the dome. It can get very busy so best to go at opening time early in the morning and better if you have a private guide booked and paid for in advance.
40,Tajmahal,Awesome,"Beautiful place to visit and children's are very happy during the visit of Taj Mahal. But due to summer season, the stone that ie Marble is getting too hot and sometimes it is not possible to walk on them without shoes. Best duration to visit Taj Mahal is September to February."
40,Tajmahal,famous monument,"well crafted, intricate designs, symbol of LOVE. A must visit for each couple in Love. white colored on river bank, blossoms in full moon night"
40,Tajmahal,Don't go midday!,"It is a picturesque scene, but if you are going in May or June you should really avoid the peak sun (12 to 4 pm)."
40,Tajmahal,Jewel of India,"Despite of not having much interest in history, I found this an amazing monument. It is difficult to appreciate the place unless you have seen this yourself."
40,Tajmahal,Excellence,No need to say that this is the high light of the trip to India. the magnificent building with the touching story behind it. Do not miss it.
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,It was great. one of the seven wonders of the world everything was worth it just enjoyed the view of the Taj Mahal.
40,Tajmahal,Truly a Wonder!,No wonder its a Wonder of the World.  Be alert of scams of souvenir selling from the outlets just outside the Taj. Just go to the town and visit souvenir shops. Do not even listen to the vendors. They are a disgrace to the Taj Mahal.
40,Tajmahal,Spectacular,"The city in itself is silly and dirty, the drive to the city can be good bad or very good depending on what route you take for it or you do the trains that start from Delhi ( nizammudin train station every hour crossing Agra since these are all south india bound trains from the capital) but 1200 Rs later and all that pain Taj does blow your mind away.It is a wonder of the world and it makes sense to be here to take all that trouble.  If you do come so fr I would highly suggest doing the FatehpurSikri tour as well which is about 40 kms away. Hire a taxi for whole day for Rs 1500 and cover both these places. You may have to haggle to get a nice AC Cab but my Indian friend helped me and it was very easy."
40,Tajmahal,World wonder.,I fulfilled the dream by visit Taj Mahal. This must visit once in your life. I have no words say about this wold wonder. Choose early morning visit to avoid the hot and sunlight. Buy shoe cover from the ticket counter to avoid remove shoes.
40,Tajmahal,heaven on earth,One advice if you want to see taj then visit it here early in the morning as shoes or socks are not allowed inside. As we all know place is awsum and architecture is marvelous.
40,Tajmahal,beautiful place to visit,"Amazing place, it's more beautiful than i ever imagined. We enjoyed a lot and had a bunch of pictures in front of taj mahal. Nicely briefed by the local guide and even they charged very less price. This is the only place in agra where when you visit and thinks that this is totally worth to visit agra."
40,Tajmahal,Real wonder of the world,"Taj Mahal doesn't need an introduction.  Standing on the banks of River Yamuna, Its a beautiful peice of Architecture and is a result of the hard work of million of workers over 20 years..  One would surely go out bound on seeing this. Architecture is same from all four sides with beautiful garden in front.  I would just suggest visitors to reach early to avoid long queue."
40,Tajmahal,Excellent Architecture,"Amazing view everywhere. A must place to visit when you go India.  There will be a lot of saler outside of Taj Mahal, don't be scared of them. It is your choice to buy from them or not. If you running out of time, you may choose to buy from them."
40,Tajmahal,Modern World Wonder,"Truly beautiful and the symmetry was amazing. I would recommend all to come and see, even from a long distance. Take a guide also."
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal <3,It was my dream place to come... this is the only reason i am in India and its Worthy !  Incredible India !
40,Tajmahal,Amazing...this truly world wonder,"I am touched and thrilled !! This is the highlight of my India tour. I cannot tell you how I enjoyed because this only can be feel there in front od marble walls. If you are there, please try to visit early morning like 6am as we did. Spent enough time to see the outdoor walls of main building with beautiful marbles."
40,Tajmahal,Don't have pens or pencils in your bag!,"I took a trip from the Ibis Hotel in New Dehli, the tour included a guide. I was a solo female traveler and couldn't have been better looked after. The whole trip was smooth and well organized apart from the fact I had pens and pencils in my bag at security! No pencil allowed inside, just a small hiccup. I loved the early morning experience before things got really busy and hot. The Taj is breathtaking and well worth getting out of bed early and the three-hour drive."
40,Tajmahal,Taj,"A guide made the day very valuable, providing lots of information not readily available. A very hot day, much of the site very open so cover up."
40,Tajmahal,Exceeds all expectations,The beauty and perfect symmetry are impossible to put into words. Exceeds all expectations. The best time to go is sunrise when the weather is cooler and there are less visitors .
40,Tajmahal,Must vist,This is a must visit place. Opt for a guide and get along a photographer. We got ourselves clicked in plenty and are now in love with the pics..
40,Tajmahal,Amazing,"You need to time this right - we left our hotel in New Delhi at 3 am and unfortunately missed sunrise but hey ho, it was still worth going at that time for the empty roads, lack of queues, few beggars and for an easy walk in hot but not hellish weather. The Taj Mahal is really really lovely, so beautiful - yes it is a bit dirty but this is India what do you expect really!?  As we left at 10.30 it was topping 45 degrees and getting very busy so I was grateful for the early start. I booked a driver from the hotel - expensive - over £200 for the two of us but safe and comfortable and the hotel booked a guide. We were told to pay 300 rupees to the guide by a friend but he was most annoyed with us and we ended up paying 1000 (which really isn't a lot at the end of the day just all a bit embarrassing and annoying when you don't know what to expect."
40,Tajmahal,Incredible,Beautiful story behind this masterwork. We caught the sunrise and it was definitely worth waking at at 4:00 am for.
40,Tajmahal,Awesome!!,Awesome but tiring visit! Go in winter time to enjoy its beauty! Place is unkempt though..people do not have common civic sense.
40,Tajmahal,Architecture at its best,No words to describe its beauty and architecture. It's a real jewel on India's crown. Went with my business associated from USA they were awestruck by its sheer beauty.
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal - a must see as 1 of 7 wonders of world!,"I highly recommend that you visit the Taj Mahal while in India. We were on a business trip and staying in Delhi when we decided to hire a driver through the hotel to take us to the Taj Mahal. We also had a private guide. I highly recommend the private guide so that you don't need to wait in any lines and you also get a good understanding of the history of the Taj Mahal. The drive from Delhi was 3 1/2 hours.  Also, ensure that you wear comfortable shoes and clothing. It was 115 degrees farenheit when we visited on June 4th. Water is a must! You will be provided with shoe coverings to wear when you go inside the Taj.  There are roving photographers that will take photos of you at a very low cost. Your guide will coordinate this. We each got 10 - 5X7 pictures for only $1000 rupies. These were a great souvenier from our trip. Foreign tickets cost $1000 rupies.  Plan on a minimum of 2 hours for the tour. Please note that there is a lot of walking from where the driver and taxi can you drop off. This should be considered if you cannot walk more than a block or so especially on an uneven walk way and in the heat. You will have to go through a security check before entering as well."
40,Tajmahal,Breathtaking!!!!!,There were no words to explain the magnificent experience of visiting the Taj. My only suggestion is to plan and go there early so that you have plenty of time to visit. I visited in the evening and could not visit the tombs.
40,Tajmahal,No words. Architecture at its top,Well this place does not need any review. Its the unofficial symbol of India. Just beware of the fake guides and other vendors who will try to loot you in different ways
40,Tajmahal,Probably the most beautiful building in the world,"Majestuous! Built with white marble, finelly carved. A jewel in all senses of the term. Architectural beauty, craftmanship , and a love story."
40,Tajmahal,Main attraction in India,"This is the main attraction in India, you must see and it is very romantic story behind it also. Taj Mahal was built by Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife Mumtaz. In my opinion the best time to visit it about 1-1.5 hour before sunset. It is not as hot as in the middle of the day and also beautiful when sun goes down. It is a lot of security and restrictions out there but I was disgusting by amount of garbage locals leave inside."
40,Tajmahal,Amazing Taj,"We left our hotel which was near to the airport in Delhi at 4am. The trip took 3.5 hours (Sunday morning at the beginning of June). Our driver took us to East gate car park. The car park was empty, there were no queues to purchase tickets. We paid the 1000Rps for a ticket, a pair of shoe coverings, a bottle of water and a ride in the bus to the entrance. The bus journey takes about 5 minutes. There were were only 2 guides selling their services and no one trying to sell you anything. We agreed a price with one of the guides and he hopped on the bus with us to the gate entrance. Again there were no queues. We travelled light, just a camera, mobile phone and water. We took our own photos or we asked our guide too. The Taj is really beautiful. We only once encountered a queue as we moved around the site and this was for Lady Diana's bench. There were two others waiting. Our tour took about 2 hours which was perfect for us. There was litter around the gardens but there were people tidying up. A couple of the towers are being renovated but this didn't impact on our visit. Our tour guide took us back to the bus stop and reminded us to be vigilant as there were pick pockets around. We hopped back on the bus to the car park. As we stepped off the bus we were surrounded by beggars and people selling thing. We couldn't move more than a couple of steps without being hounded. The car park was now full and there was a queue for tickets and the bus. I would recommend going very early."
40,Tajmahal,Very good experience,Visit to Taj mahal in Agra was a life time experience. It's a marvelous and magnificent. A ticket of Rs 40 is charged from Indian visitors. I have booked a guide. He charged Rs 275 and explained about Taj mahal but Taj mahal is out standing as a historical monument.
40,Tajmahal,Stunning beauty,The Taj Mahal is probably the most beautiful place I have ever seen close up. If you view early morning then you will avoid the crowds and the worst of the heat. Make sure you have an experienced Guide to make the most of this wonderful palace
40,Tajmahal,A must visit,"A must visit but was sad to note that there was chaos at the ticket counter with lot of touts. This being a place where lot of foreign tourists visit, should have been maintained better. There is no drinking water facility inside."
40,Tajmahal,Thinking about your visit to one of the world's greatest historic structures?,"The Taj Mahal is probably the premier tourist attraction in a nation that abounds with natural features and historic monuments. It’s certainly what draws so many people to Agra whether for a day trip from Delhi or to stay and enjoy more of the local sights.  There is no shortage of information on the Taj Mahal so I’ll only include a brief summary before moving on to practicalities for the traveller. The Taj Mahal was built for the third and favourite wife of the Emperor Shah Jahan. Mumtaz Mahal was originally buried in Buhanpur where she died during childbirth in 1631. The following year Shah Jahan had construction of the Taj Mahal started as her final resting place and she was buried there in 1634 though it took another 6 years for the main structure to be completed and the site as a whole wasn’t finished until 1653. Shah Jahan himself was laid to rest in a tomb beside his beloved wife in the same year as the Great Fire of London, 1666 having spent the previous 8 years under house arrest after being overthrown by his son, able to do little more than look out across the river to Mumtaz’s tomb.  The first thing to remember when planning a visit to the Taj Mahal is that it opens very early at 6am but is closed on Fridays. There are three entrances, West, South and East and when we visited it’s the latter that we used. The advantage of the East and South entrances is that you can find fairly comfortable accommodation in the Taj Ganj area on the Eastern outskirts of Agra that will put you within a short walk of a gate and is rather quieter than the centre of town. In our case we used the East Entrance and stayed on Taj East Gate Road about 500m away. A number of the hotels and guesthouses in this area have rooftop restaurants or small observation terraces from which you can easily see the Taj Mahal from where you are staying as was the case with ours. Bear in mind though that only the West and South entrances have ticket offices. That for the East entrance is 750m away from the entrance itself in a long modern looking brick building on the left as you head towards the Taj Mahal. The East entrance seems to be the one favoured by tour groups and, like their tour guides; there is nothing to stop you purchasing your ticket on the evening before your visit if you plan to make an early start. Ticket offices open at 6am, the same time as the gates to the Taj Mahal open, so if you want to try to beat other visitors, especially to take photographs without tourists in the foreground, then already having a ticket will help to take you to the front of the queue and even at 6am there will be queues, parallel ones in each case with one for men and one for women. This isn’t some form of discrimination, it makes sense near the head of the queue if someone is to be searched. Another two points are worth noting when you buy your ticket. Firstly, if you see another queue in front of the ticket counters that looks shorter than the other and you aren’t Indian check before you join it. Tickets for foreigners are much higher at 750 rupees (at the time of writing) and there is a separate window for Indian and foreign visitors. The second point is to make sure you look for another counter before leaving where you can pick up a free pair of disposable over-shoes and a small bottle of water. You won’t be allowed to take your own drinks in and though you won’t have to take your shoes off when entering the Taj Mahal itself (not the grounds and other structures) you will have to cover them.  As you approach the entrance gate itself you will see a long counter ahead. At this point you will be very quickly frisked and may be asked to show any items you have in your pockets. Your bag will also be looked into and it’s possible that you may be told that some items are not permitted. A couple we spoke to were still annoyed that a number of apparently harmless items were taken off them including a pen, sketch book and even a book of Sudoku puzzles. I walked in with a shoulder bag holding my free water, a small camera bag, notebook, pens and a pencil and had no problem. The approach therefore seems inconsistent and decided as much by the individual as by policy but as a rule of thumb take as little as you can with you. If staying in Agra this is easy but probably less so if on a day trip from New Delhi, but it’s something to be aware of. One thing you can and should take with you is a torch. The interior of the Taj Mahal itself is relatively dark and to see and admire the intricate stonework a torch is essential. In fact I would compare the interior to a cave because it has a surprising ability to ‘soak up’ light for something constructed primarily of white marble. To see anything of the ceiling therefore you will need something small but quite powerful such as a cree torch. Two or three people had these when we visited and they did allow some detail high up to be seen in more detail, albeit in the small field afforded by the beam of the torch.  As with many historic sites it makes some sense to have a rough plan in mind. What will you head for first, in what order will you look around things and what is most important to you? If you want a chance at the classic photography on a marble seat or standing with the Taj Mahal in the background and you arrive early for it then make your way towards it straight away and admire the architecture elsewhere later. A lot of people arrive very quickly and the chance of a photograph without people in the background is very slim indeed. At the most popular spots you will probably find yourself in another impromptu queue as my wife did, waiting for that great holiday shot. Beyond that there is no point in hurrying. The Southern entrance has a magnificent 30m high gateway inscribed with quranic verses and built of red sandstone in contrast to the white of the Taj Mahal. Anywhere else it would be worth a visit and is still worth admiring even though here it’s just the way in! Beyond lies the symmetry of the grounds leading to the Taj Mahal , divided by long shallow rectangular pools in which the Taj Mahal is reflected and a great place for a multitude of photographs with the Taj Mahal and its four 40m high minarets in view. A panorama from the marble plinth in the midst of the pools is also worthwhile, especially if you can include the two great sandstone buildings to either side in a 180 degree shot.  Sadly photography is strictly prohibited inside the mausoleum itself where even despite the very poor lighting it would be possible to capture something of the beauty and atmosphere without a flash, but it is a mausoleum. That said when we visited there were two uniformed men at the entrance but only one plainly dressed gentleman inside who seemed to walk endless circles around the filigree marble screen that surrounds the cenotaphs of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan. He made his way around occasionally blowing a whistle and conspicuously unable to prevent the dozens of photographs being taken with mobile phones and cameras so in truth whether or not you can photograph the interior depends on whether respect the ban. The interior is beautiful but difficult admire in the slowly circling crowd and poor lighting so once again I’d remind you to take a torch if you want to really see the variety of semi precious stones that form the inlay in the screen and walls. The most popular spot is at the break in the marble screen through which the two ‘tombs’ are visible and quite captivating even though the two people they represent lie quite some way below.  Once satisfied, head back a little way and make your way around the surrounding rooms where the finely cut marble screens that admit light also offer some interesting vignettes of the buildings opposite if you have your camera (you aren’t photographing the interior by doing that). At the rear of the building you can step out through the great archway that mirrors that through which you entered (there is one on each side). Known as Pishtaqs these help to illuminate the interior as well as being a beautiful architectural feature, with verses from the Quran flanking them and climbing the walls as you look up. The terrace here makes a good place to view the river and the very understated gardens of the Mehtab Bag on the opposite bank, often cited as one of the best viewpoints from which to photograph the Taj Mahal. As you walk and take in the whole remember to keep looking for details and not only in the stonework – apparently unnoticed by other visitors up above me as I walked around there were two young birds of prey struggling to balance on stone gutter while elsewhere monkeys would occasionally appear on the walls.  Of the two great sandstone structures to either side I noticed that one was attracting the crowds while the other was relatively quiet so it’s worth watching where the crowds are and adjusting your tour of the grounds accordingly. Curiously the building attracting all the attention was the ‘jawab’ whose sole purpose was to provide symmetry to the arrangement while the almost empty structure to which I made my way first was the mosque on the West side, again a beautiful structure in its own right with wonderful arches, inlay and ceilings. On this side too it’s possible to make your way back towards the entrance and take in the Taj Museum along the way. This opens later so if you arrived early it makes sense to head around the West side of the gardens last. The museum doesn’t allow photography either which is a pity. I won’t mention much about it because it has its own reviews elsewhere on Trip Advisor, but among the things I personally found really interesting were the ‘farmans’, imperial decrees direct from the emperor himself that I was surprised to find being taken up with small grants of land to people rather than great affairs of state. Miniatures of both Shah Jahan and his wife Mumtaz Mahan were fascinating by making the people in the tomb just visited so much more real.  Lastly, I would recommend a slow walk around the gardens to look at the wildlife. This seemed to be largely overlooked by other visitors while we were there but there were a number of interesting birds, such as hoopoes and a lovely grey hornbill as well as the monkeys already mentioned making and occasional showing, mainly on the walls. If you headed straight to the Taj Mahal on arrival don’t forget the great Southern entrance but keep in mind the route you took on arriving, it’s not that hard to lose your sense of direction at the end of the visit and find yourself heading for a different gate to the one you entered by.  Although the best view of the Taj Mahal is from within the grounds as you might expect there are other places from which you can view it and see it in the landscape that surrounds it. One of the most frequently mentioned is from the park of Mehtab Bagh on the opposite bank of the Yamuna River which effectively puts you behind it. If you are thinking about photographing it from here think more carefully about where the sun will be and how it will be lit. We were told it's also possible to view the Taj Mahal from a boat though we saw no organised trips advertised (which seems a little surprising) and you may have to ask locally. There are views from rooftop terraces in the Taj Ganj area where we stayed and even if you are in the centre of town it may be possible to eat at one of the rooftop cafe's or restaurants for the view and the romance of an evening meal with the Taj Mahal in the distance while the sun sets over Agra, something we rather enjoyed just for the feeling of being there. If you do this think about any other buildings or trees that may obstruct the view or ask beforehand. Yet another possibility is the Taj Nature Walk on the Taj East Gate Road. It's a little misrepresented in being home to more courting couples than wildlife and will cost you 100 rupees each to go in but there are some limited views of the Taj Mahal and other buildings rising above the trees though I don't think it's worth visiting for the view. Finally, among the viewpoints we found my personal favourite was that from the Red Fort looking down the river. The view can be a little hazy because of the distance and, unless you are willing to crop your photo, you will need a lens of around 400mm at least to bring the Taj Mahal nicely into the frame but I think this is one of the best spots to capture it in its setting on the river bank.  We very much enjoyed our visit and it’s not often we have the opportunity to stand beside one of the greatest structures and historical buildings on Earth. I very much hope you enjoy your trip at least as much and that some of this will have been helpful to you."
40,Tajmahal,Great pice of architecture.,"Great pice of architecture, the gardens are great the Taj Mahal its just grate, it's a most see pice.  I've been on June and the temperature is really hot, you have to go early in the morning, because the temperature will go to 45 degrees at noon."
40,Tajmahal,Stunning!!,"It is no wonder why the Taj is among the seven wonders! It was breathtaking!! I was deeply disturbed by the poor maintenance. A place which generates so much tourism, I would have expected it to be better looked after."
40,Tajmahal,Stunning place,"Wow, wow wow! There are no words other than absolute beauty! I didn't like the fuss, I felt like the locals were begging me to accept them, obviously for money to guide me around. I would have thought by now the people working there could move locals on, who are not working there to prevent them from touting! I think it was spoiled by the amount of people who were there and I mean thousands I felt suffocated at times plus it was so hot. Absolutely stunning though."
40,Tajmahal,Largest physical memorial to love,"Exceeded my expectations. The grounds are beautiful, well maintained - watch out for the monkeys! For a fun tourist experience you can also sit on the same bench as Princess Diana in that iconic photograph. Before entering the Taj you must take off your shoes or cover them (covers provided). Exquisite and intricate marble inlay work, on the flooring, walls and pillars. Built by a mughal king to honor his wife after her death. On her death bed, she asked him to do something that would last long after they were both gone. Her wish came true. She is entombed inside the Taj. Her husband alongside her. With the exception of the king's tomb, the Taj is perfectly and accurately symmetrical. As an added bonus there are also two mosques on either side of the Taj. Go in the mornings or late afternoons when it's a bit cooler and you can avoid the lines."
40,Tajmahal,Amazing. A must see,I cant describe how beautiful this is. We had a private guided tour. All of the colors used are actually gem stones. Definitely worth the trip.
40,Tajmahal,Best Monument in the World,"I have travelled to a few places covering mostly Europe, Asia and North America and i can say that I have not seen a better man made structure which overawed me so much. Monument of love or a debatable Hindu temple it certainly is the most beautiful man-made structure on earth. See it to believe it!"
30,Tajmahal,nice taj mahal,very well. i recommend to hire formal guid to visit taj mahal .there are lots of hidden point to explore with guid
30,Tajmahal,The mighty graveyard,Visited on a hot & cloudy day. The mighty grave yard - no wonder its in seven wonders of the world. Avoid weekends to avoid unimaginable crowd. too hard to describe the beauty in words. One must experience it.
30,Tajmahal,A LONG CHERISHED WISH FULFILLED,"visited Taj Mahal, Agra on 24.10.2015. after entering the main premises, when reached in front of the TAJ, my eyes remained open for a while while wathcing its beauty. I said Oh! Taj.............. really its a wonderful piece of architect, marvellous."
30,Tajmahal,It really is a Wonder with a capital 'W',"Drove here with family and friends from New Delhi. Wasn't psyched when I heard it was going to be 5 hours in the car (maybe more depending on traffic) to get to Agra however all these irritations slipped away when I got my first glimpse of the Taj Mahal, rightfully one of the Seven Wonders of the World. A little gasp escaped my lips for it really is a sight to behold and no picture does it credit. Up close it is even more beautiful, the details exquisite. If you are planning a trip to India make sure you include Agra because the Taj Mahal is worth it and is a definite must see. It is a bit pricey, for foreigners must pay almost triple what a local pays to get in and you have to wear little shoe protectors. We didn't have a guide which i truly regret it would have been nice to learn about the history and so on. It was packed! however I found that almost everywhere in India, just the sheer amount of people is astonishing though. Just a warning as a Westerner I was way laid by locals asking for photos with me."
30,Tajmahal,One off my bucket list,"Travelling from Delhi to Agra takes around 3 hours, and if you're with a big group (there were eight of us), I recommend booking a private car for your ease and comfort. When you get to the Taj Mahal, look for a guide that knows the ins and outs of the Taj, and one that is well versed in the lore surrounding the Shah Jahan's story and what it took to build this amazing building.  If you're coming from outside Agra, remember to leave early (we left Delhi at 6:00 am to get there around 9 am) so that its not too hot when you get there (we had no choice since we went there during the summer season, 47 degree weather is oppressive).  Wear comfortable walking shoes, bring lots of water, and an umbrella and shades if you're planning to go during the summer. We were told that its best to visit the Taj Mahal during the winter season (November-January). Wearing loose, comfortable clothing is a must, it was a good thing that we bought cotton kurtas prior to our visit to the Taj.  If you get hungry after your tour, there are a lot of restaurants in the area, but do not, I repeat, do not fall for invitations from your tour guide or driver to buy marble knick knacks or shop at a local market, the prices at these places are very, very high! Our tour guide was quite pushy when it came to this because these guides get a commission if they bring a group into these shops.  If you want to shop for handicrafts, I suggest going to the markets in Delhi (Janpath, Dili Haat)."
30,Tajmahal,Amazing,"Truly amazing place to visit. It looks even better then the pictures. It is good to get a guide to go with you as you with get more details and history. Before you enter you can get a photographer who will follow you around, he also knows all the best places for the most amazing pictures, so worth the money when you see the wonderful pictures , as opposed to just snapping them your self."
30,Tajmahal,Super,Taj Mahal is a symbol of love. Must visit if in Agra. Taj is located on the bank of river Yamuna And made of white marble.Photography allowed in side campus.
30,Tajmahal,The white palace,If you have a guide then you will get a clear picture about the place and he can show the perfect place to take pictures
30,Tajmahal,Take time to enjoy the detais as well!,"Seeing the Taj will for sure be an experience, and it's worth the drive from Dehli. The Taj has a great story, a lot of history and so many great details. So read a bit before you go or hire a guide."
30,Tajmahal,Bucket List item completed!!,"FYI, the Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays (only opens for religious services this day). You do have to wear booties over your shoes to protect the floor. Having a guide is definitely the way to go and ours, Sunny, navigated us around the crowds in and outside as well as provide lots of history of the family as well as the construction. He also assisted with great photo ops all over the grounds.  Seeing the Taj Mahal in person is simply amazing and I can cross it off my bucket list! The architecture is astonishing and the story that goes along with it, so beautiful. There is symmetry everywhere except for the crypts where the Emperor and his wife. His wife’s tomb is in the center and his is off to the one side.  The inlaid stone work is absolutely beautiful and worth taking a look up close. The guide showed us that the red stone actually glows with light. He showed us pictures of the Taj Mahal at different times of the day and how the light affected the color of the stone.  There was cleaning work being done on three of the four minarets but did not diminish the beauty of the structure. We understand that maintenance constantly needs to be done to keep up the structure.  Unfortunately, there was a bit of trash (water bottles, food wrappers, etc) around the grounds despite trash bins being in close proximity."
30,Tajmahal,"Wah Taaj, Ye Dil mange More","Some says one must see it in his/her life time, some says different story but just like when you dip in holy river ganga, moving around a sea beach or relaxing in a hill station, Taaj calls you again and again. We must preserve and maintain it not only just a wonder monument but sign of love also. Last but not least pollution affects should be taken care of more seriously."
30,Tajmahal,"Yes, It's Amazing","Well, it is the Taj, the creation of Shah Jahan, a Mughal ruler who became of the subcontinent's great emperor-builders. The Taj is a mausoleum, built for Mumtaz, the favorite wife of Jahan. Its beauty lies in its symmetry and its semi-precious gem-laden marble exterior which is second to nothing, really. The four minarets slant outward 5 degrees so that they would fall away from the Taj during an earthquake. Please note that three of them are currently laden with scaffolding - don't know how long that will last. This is an unfortunate necessity since it does take away from the overall feeling of balance and symmetry that the Taj usually puts forth. This is a vast complex and a very busy place. Allow a few hours / a morning (preferred) / or an afternoon and be prepared for large crowds. If you are a whitie (especially one with blond hair) be prepared to take the time to take a few photos with the locals who will constantly be asking you."
30,Tajmahal,The Taj The monument of Love,"About two hundred kilometres away is this beautiful structure the Monument of Love, It is indeed amoung the seven wonders of The World. Build by Emperor Saha Jahan in memory of his wife that is has become the monument of love. If one visits India and does not visit the beauty He or She has not seen any thing so beautiful"
30,Tajmahal,"Amazing, nothing else, words leave me....a MUST VISIT.","Visited this monument twice now and never tire of just being in the energy.Only wish was, NO one else there, just selfish me. the crowds, noises etc.....but what can you expect with such an amazing tourist attraction. if going to India, this is ONE place you cannot miss out!"
30,Tajmahal,Excellent tour travelling down to Agra.,Seeing the Taj Mahal is a breath taking experience. Great area for taking photographs of memorable sights including the Indian ladies in their colourful dress.  India is a wonderful country to tour and enjoy the variation in the sights between northern and central India. The people are friendly and the variation in food is wonderful to taste.  But seeing the Taj is an experience you will never forget.
30,Tajmahal,Amazing,"Of course you have red a lot of opinions about Taj Mahal, most of them positive or more than that. In my opinión it is one of the most impressive buildings I have ever visited all around the world. Go there and experiencie it by yourselve."
30,Tajmahal,Get there early 5.30 a.m to beat the crowds,"Lived up to expectations. A very emotional visit, caught up in the spiritual atmosphere of the Taj. We were taken by our guide at 5.30 a.m which turned out to be great advice. No queuing , not so hot and the crowds were arriving as we were leaving. Taj is a spectacle that did not let us down. The wonders of this build is an amazing sight. The two domes to the sides and the grand entrance add to the overall atmosphere. Incidentally we were approached by the professional residential photographer on our way in . Our guide negotiated £10 fir six photos. What a great deal. The photos were very professionally taken and I had an amazing set of photos to bring home with me. My advice. Use the photographers services."
30,Tajmahal,The Taj,"Made even more popular by the late and beautiful Princess Diana siting on that bench, if visiting go early to avoid the crowds who want a photo on that famous bench with the Taj in the background, The Taj it self is a work of engineering masterpiece and the story behind it is a wonderful story of a mans love for his departed wife.."
30,Tajmahal,Don't take a guide,A magical awe inspiring place. It literally bought tears of emotion on first sight. My one bit of advice if traveling as a romantic couple would be to read up on the history beforehand and then just soak up the romance and love that this place inspires as having a guide wittering on about facts ruins the emotion of the visit somewhat.
30,Tajmahal,Memorable Taj Mahal,"This is an incredible place, amazing architecture and marble work and now, beautifully restored to its former glory. Don't go through Agra without seeing it."
30,Tajmahal,Once in a lifetime magic,"It kind of feels ridiculous to review the Taj Mahal. I mean, it's the Taj Mahal. It's one of the wonders of the world. It's freaking spectacular. PS. Clean loos, but don't forget to take your own toilet paper :)"
30,Tajmahal,Excellent,Words can't describe the beauty of Taj. Must visit. Try to reach there early morning and on a clear day (If you are a photo enthusiastic)
30,Tajmahal,Most amazing n enchanting experience,"First of all great thanks to Akshay at reception desk, kushhboo,Ravi Pandey, vikram n the list is endless for making the trip so magnificent We checked in on 28th ...room was upgraded to executive class with Taj view N hospitality from all the staff was the best one can receive staring from the main gate guard till the room ever one ushered amazing hospitality. Hotel services were best in class n the most authentic n amazing food Thx to all the team specially Mr ravi Pandey n akshay for making this trip memorable...would like to surely visit again"
30,Tajmahal,Magical,Bet the crowds by going early and catch the sunrise at the Taj! Beautiful and the buildings next door are just as amazing.
30,Tajmahal,Truly Amazing!,"I understand why it's called one of the great wonders of the world. It is absolute perfection. Hard to believe it was built so long ago, by hand, without today's technology. Amazing!"
50,Tajmahal,Birthday present to myself,I have been wanting to visit the Taj Mahal for 40 years. I went there this year for my 65th birthday and it was as amazing as I thought it would be. I was there for sunrise and sunset. I would highly recommend this UNESCO heritage site.
50,Tajmahal,a breath taking monument,"It is such a beautiful structure - never have seen a mausoleum to be so incredible to look at. The monument is well maintained.  Be aware of the guides --- you will find plenty of them. Fix the rates well in advance. If you don't want to spend money on the guides, there are enough information available on internet."
50,Tajmahal,Love and Romance Celebrated,"In 1952 I was given one of the most wonderful birthday presents ever. It was Richard Halliburton's ""Complete Book of Marvels"". I must have read it 1000 times, dreaming about the places he had seen and would I ever get to any of them. One of the places was the Taj Mahal in Agra, India. I was fascinated, and after devouring this tribute of love while studying to be an architect I thought I knew all about it. Boy was I wrong!  As soon as I passed through the gates, leading from the reality of Agra into the fantasy of the Taj Mahal I was smitten. I stopped right then and there and didn't want to move any further. Obviously I did move and I spent the next 3 hours exploring. The inlays, the dome, the stone, the symmetry. Beauty and love are everywhere you look.  The Taj Mahal is probably the most photographed building in the world. I must have taken over 300 myself. It is that amazing and overwhelming. I, for one, wanted to see every detail and nuance of the architecture and the materials.  Before the Indian Government starts limiting the number of visitors to this UNESCO Heritage Site, visit it. You CANNOT be disappointed by the physical beauty of this tribute to love. There are rules and regulations surrounding a visit, so be prepared well ahead of time. A little research will go a long way to making your visit hit you inside and not just from what you can see."
50,Tajmahal,Breathtaking...,"It is all you have heard and more... more in the sense that there are gardens, fountains, side and front areas to explore. A wonderful experience."
50,Tajmahal,An awesome show of CRAFTSMENSHIP AND POWER,"We had this plan to visit to Agra from a long time. The aura of seeing one of the ""Seven wonders on Mother Earth"" had to be huge. We drove down from Delhi to Mathura and landed up in Agra. I had this huge fascination of being in presence of one of the BEST MOMENT in my life, but frankly speaking it started dying down as we entered the AGRA CITY. The city was awfully bad In-respect of the World class monument. Anyways, we went to near the TAJ MAHAL parking and hired a battery rickshaw for Rs 100/- though the distance was not too much just 500-600 meters. We also hired a local guide for Rs 570, though again we could have bargained and settled for less. But why bargain? We then went through the ticket window and also got shoe covers. Our guide told it was compulsory, and we were happy to note that. As we entered we could feel the REAL AURA OF THE ....TAJ MAHAL. It's CRAFTSMENSHIP is beyond words. ITS HUGE, MAGNIFICIENT AND AN BESUTIFUL MASTER PIECE.... I should make a make that u must...MUST visit this monument to believe it's ART. The guide told us a lot of things from history..but the saddest part that what we see the present TAJ MAHAL is not in its REAL / ORIGINAL form. It's what is the left overs and only the building structure. Had it been the real thing with jewels and stones and gold.....it would have been the ONLY of its kind."
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal has to be a destination that should not be missed.,I was fortunate to spen a lot of time in India and visited some outstanding sights. Taj Mahal is special in so many aspects. The Architecture and the workmanship is one of a kind. One should spend a lot of time there to appreciate this magnificent monument dedicated to love.
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal So Beautiful,"Visiting the Taj Mahal was without a doubt the highlight of my trip to India. I don’t normally get excited over buildings but how can you not get excited about the Taj Mahal!? For as long as I can remember I’ve been entranced by the massive domes, the curved archways and the way the sun shimmers off the white marble. If you’re travelling to India and you’re thinking about skipping the Taj Mahal because, let’s face it, we’ve all seen a million pictures of it already, I strongly recommend you reconsider. There is such a beautiful and magical atmosphere and photos really can’t do this incredible building justice."
50,Tajmahal,Symbol of Love,"Tajmahal don't require any introduction,it is monument where you automatically say ""Amazing"".You cant explain the beauty of Tajmahal in words.I have been living in Agra since 2008 even i seen the Tajmahal from the road so many time.I never been inside the premises.After completed my degree in tourism i got a job in travel company.Once company assigned me duty to go Tajmahal with guest ,i seen the beauty and architecture , it was words-less."
50,Tajmahal,Awesome!!,"It is a great place, everyone should visit once in a lifetime. Astonishing architecture. Visit at appropriate times to avoid heat. Please do not visit on Fridays(It is closed on Friday)."
50,Tajmahal,Must see Place in your lifetime,"The place we must have to visit atleast once in our lifetime, I visited it 5 times and still eager to go there, it is awesome during Full moon.."
50,Tajmahal,The Wonder of Love,Once you are there you actually feel why Taj is one of the Seven wonders of the world. Its amazing experience to be there. Early morning visit is reccommended if you wish to enjoy the visit and take away maximum from the wonderful memory of Mumtaj and Shahjahan.  Would love to visit again and again..
50,Tajmahal,AMAZING,I have been to many places and I can easily say that this is in my top 3. This place is so beautiful and I highly recommend that you get a tour guide to get the full-experience and hear the background story.
50,Tajmahal,Wonderful,Me and my family visited this world wonder.really a wonderful place.nearest palaces to visit is agra fort and mathura.travelling from Delhi by cab is easy for luxury travellers
50,Tajmahal,No one will describe you this place good enough. You shall see it yourself!,"In fact, this is a mavsoleum and two bodies are kept underneath (regular visitors are not allowed to go there but only on the second/higher level). On the other hand, it's a very nice, buitiful and peaceful place. Among all destinations, I have visited around the globe, it was the first time when I wanted to stay as long as I can. It was like a magnet. It looks strange but it was real. Magneficient place! The buity of the mavsoleum itself is a different subject. The technology that was used to create the buity from marlbors of different colors and hardnesses is unlikly achievable today with all computitional capabilities. I was lucky as my guide was a retired photographer who (took pictures of Princess Diana when she was once there and) followed thousands other tours for decades to learn a lot about Taj Mahal's structure and history. To get to the city of Agra where Taj Mahal is located you need to drive from Delhi."
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal a token of Love...!!!,Taj Mahal requires no introduction. It is the best token of Love by one of the greatest lover of art for his loving wife. Although the shine has deteriorated over the years but it is still very beautiful.
50,Tajmahal,mesmorizing,I have been To Taj a lot with My friends while i used to work at Jaipur. i have been To Taj more than 50 Times.i Think its best Place in India to Go
50,Tajmahal,Mesmerising and worthwhile,"As one of the Seven Wonders of The World that was built by an Emperor in Agra, this is still one of the main draws of India - both for foreign and domestic visitors. It's a long drive (~3.5 hours) or a shorter train ride from Delhi, you must have this as part of your plan. Pricing varies based on whether you're an Indian or a foreigner, and tickets are readily available from a nearby outpost.  The entire place requires people to wear shoe gloves to protect the marble work. Even to this day, descendants of the workers who built it are involved in the constant restoration.maintenance work to keep this in its pristine glory state. Weather may affect your visit, but sunshine will easily come out to dry up the place.  Foreigners are highly recommended to get a tour guide with them, and will be good if they have Indian friends with them to help navigate the language barrier."
50,Tajmahal,Very Inspirational,It's a wonderful architecture but sometimes very crowded as it attracts a lot of visitors. A place to really visit if you are travelling to India as it's very beautiful.
50,Tajmahal,Beauty of love,This is the symbol of love. the structure of Taj mahal make it's wonder of the world. i prefer to all.
50,Tajmahal,Not to be missed!,"Stunning monument! Pictures do not convey its beauty. It is awe inspiring, and a must see. Take your time exploring, there is much to see."
50,Tajmahal,Relaxing,"Taj Mahal - Historical Monument of our country. It is truly a piece of art. Built in someone's memory, it truly reflects the passion of love. Nice views and scenes. You will feel relaxed. Must Go."
50,Tajmahal,Magical,"What an amazing monument. must visit....take a tour of the full grounds. be careful of pickpockets.,"
50,Tajmahal,Review,It is the one among the seven wonders .it's an ancient place which was build in the memory of shahjahans beloved wife mumtaz.Now a days it is remembered as a sign of love .It is a very good and woeful place
50,Tajmahal,LOVABLE WONDERLAND OF THE WORLD IN INDA,"Dear travellers, it is my request kindly please enter Tajmahal with a Guide. Lots of secrecies which they can only tell. I took a guide TRIP ADVISOR guide Namely.. Mr Faheem Khan cell Number +91-9997457477 an authorised tour guide and escort from Jajmahal. In such way he has shown the entire tajmahal with the secrecies in and around the taj.  Dear visitors Kindly please DONOT VISIT TAJ MAHAL ON FRIDAY .. IT WILL BE CLOSED.. The seventh wonder of the world . First of is kind of a love and memory temple of one's wive's death. Build by Emperor Shaj Jahan for his lovable and beauty third wife MumTajMahal who died at the age of 40. Most recognizable and iconic images of the worlds 7th wonder built with 28 types of precious and non precious stones from Iran, China and whiite marble from Rajastan. 22000 hard employees with stone cutters, embroidery workers and architects worked day and night with the command of chief architect of this love memory temple sri. Ustad Ahmed Lahauri from Iran. Total expense of 32 million Indian rupees were spent on those days. Total height of the taj mahal is 561 feet. All the four are constructed in such a way the even if it fall it will not fall on taj mahal. In side the tomb there are lot of precious stone with golden works. Even today this can be seen with a candle light or a torch light.. There is a big garden around the Taj is now modified to british taste. Other wise the same garden was having only Roses. Servant quarters around the taj mahal Visitors are stopped at 500 meters. and they need to travel by battery car costs Rs.10/** Indian rupees. Then all are under security check. Inside the Taj mahal cameras not allowed. Visitors were allowed to go inside the TajMahal with chappels and Shoes but WITH SHOES AND CHAPPELS COVERED WITH BAG COVERS. It is an unbelievable architecture with stone carvings and etone embrodery works engraved with precious stones which glitters in dark with candle light. The entire orecious metals were stolen during the Sepoy mutiny during 1857. however few precious stones remains. Immediately after the construction The emperor Shahjahan was put under house arrest in AGRA FORT and the Shaj Jahan could see the Mahal only from Agra Fort for 8 years before he died. The Taj mahal is situated 5 kms from the city on the banks of the River Yamuna. On the back side of the Taj mahal on the other side of the River Yamuna Shajahan constructed another Tajmahal for him in Black stones but it was destroyed by his son Aurangazeb and put him under jail. Even today we can see the remains of black Taj... No doubt wonder land of architecture.. Kindly please avail Guides before entering otherwise the visitor will be blind enough...."
50,Tajmahal,Lovely to see,"Beautiful to see, and we were lucky to visit on w day that was free entry, and included entry to the real tombs which was rare.  We didn't intend to get a guide, but it was really worth it, especially for all the photos he took for us. We paid him 250 rupees for about an hour."
50,Tajmahal,Hot Agra with as equally Hot Taj Mahal,Wonderful place and recommended to get a good tour guide who can make your Taj Mahal trip even more memorable and knowledgeable. I was there for company team building and we went with Ali and Team tour guide.  This place is amazing and when you hear the story if how it was built... This makes it a wonder of the world.  Take lots of water if you in summer.
50,Tajmahal,"Yes, it's as good as people say it is but there is more to India and Agra if you want to go deeper","What can be said about the Taj Mahal that hasn't already been said? Beautiful? Yes it is, stunningly so. Crowded? Ha ha. Also yes. But much less so first thing in the morning. Symmetrical? Amazingly so, even though the vision was never completed and there is no physical black Taj across the river as was planned. Magical? Absolutely beyond a doubt. Over rated? Actually no. It is outstanding, but, no more outstanding really than anything else on this trip: the great grand child of the Bodhi Tree in Bodhgaya, Sarnath in Varanasi, Mother Ganga in all her beautiful diversity, The Shiva Temple in the mountains outside Rishikesh, Ariti on the banks of Ma Ganga, The Taj Mahal, The 'Baby Taj' and The Fort in Agra, and so many other wondrous memories and sights seen, and yet to see. Yes the Taj Mahal is stunning and a tribute to the undying love of one man for his dearly beloved wife, but the the 'Baby Taj' is equally as beautiful, and a tribute to a daughter's love for her parents. There is much more to India than the Taj Mahal, and much more to Agra too. I hope you enjoy your visit ❤️"
50,Tajmahal,Gem of India,As beautiful as gods creation. Lovely heritage preserved in a very original manner by tourism India.
50,Tajmahal,Majestic. Truly one of the man made wonders of the world,Amazing beauty of the rich history of the Maharajah. Walls inlaid with obsidian and carnelian. Desecrated by the British colonialists. Amazing restoration and history
50,Tajmahal,The Taj,"We travelled to Agra in May this year and I must say, the Taj, is an absolute joy to watch. I had been to Agra before & had fading memories of the Taj. But as soon as we entered the Taj, the view in front of us spellbound us. The splendour of the white marble surrounded by the red sandstone gates and the Yamuna was astonishing. The place however was not as clean as it should be and the ongoing construction/ restoration work in one of the 'minars' dented the feelings a bit. The heat was a bit too much though and I would recommend people to visit during the winters, preferably during the full moon."
50,Tajmahal,Fantastic,The Taj Mahal is an absulte MUST in Agra. But this everybody allready knows. It makes sense to come in the early moning as it really opens just before sunrise. At this time there are not so many people and you have a wonderfull and even more peacefull view. For the evening a special hint: Go the the other side of the river to MEHTAB BAGH to view the spectecular Tja Mahal sunset from a very good distance and in a very calm and peaceful athmospere as there are only very few people there.
50,Tajmahal,Get a guide,"So much more to see than just the outside. So many details that we wouldnt have known without a guide. Would recommend the company we used, Amin Tours (no kickbacks, can't compare them to others but they were great for us)."
50,Tajmahal,A WORLD HERITAGE MONUMENT - NO DOUBT IT IS ONE OF THE WONDERS IN THE WORLD,A must visit place in your life time with your life partner. It gives you an amazing feeling when you enter the place. The work is in progress in the entrance way and also the minar were taken into the maintenance. Govt. should pay more attention towards cleaning of the surrounding areas as it is one of the wonders in the world.
50,Tajmahal,Mesmerising Taj,Although i have been to Agra several times but the urge to vist Taj never quite faded. finally I got an opportunity to visit the legendery monument and I was truly awestruck by the sheer beauty of this splendid work of art. A true masterpiece.
50,Tajmahal,"Anything you've seen in photos or film does compete, this is absolutely breathtaking","Our trip to Agra was organised by Travel ChaCha.com, via Lisa Travel in Baga, we were met at the airport and driven directly to our hotel in Agra, a four and a half hour journey on Friday evening with stops for tea and anything else we wanted, we stayed overnight at the Hotel 'Taj Vilas', this is a lovely hotel the rooms were the best on our trip. We were met on arrival by Farid Baig, our guide for the visit to the Taj Mahal the next day, Farid asked what time we'd like to do the visit and made suggestions about the times it was very busy (and hotter). The next morning Farid met us in reception and our driver drove us to the Taj Mahal. I cannot praise our guide Farid enough, he was very informative without over doing it and a great photographer (taking lots of informal shots of us as we walked the grounds) if you're visiting India and have the time, the Taj Mahal is likely to be the highlight of your visit."
50,Tajmahal,Had a great fun !!Enjoy a lot with our leaders,When ever i go to Agra never missed to visit Taj Mahal & Agra Fort .Best time to visit to Agra is Oct- Mar.
50,Tajmahal,An absolutely incredible monument to love,"This was really my sole reason for wanting to visit India - and I am so glad it was. This place is unreal. Woman - don't take hand bags in with you as it takes a heap of time to get in and the staff having to search your hand bags just adds to that time. We viewed the Taj from the grounds and again from the other side of the Yamuna River. Sunrise and sunset are beautiful times to visit as the light changes the colours completely. The detail and intricacy of the stonework is just mind blowing. I could have spent hours here but alas it wasn't to be. Don't take photos inside the building (as they ask you not to). It is all about respect and I think that should be observed. We visited on a Saturday which meant the ponds were all empty as they clean them on Friday but that still didn't diminish the beauty of this place. Of course the Diana seat was a huge draw card for everyone but there are a heap of equally beautiful photo spots. There are professional photographers on site and they don't charge too much. If you are travelling as a party, one of you could buy photos and then get the memory stick as it will have everyone's photos on it - as we found out afterward! This is an incredibly beautiful and thought provoking sight which you really can't miss."
50,Tajmahal,Enchanting Monument,"Visited the Taj in the evening at 6.00 pm on a Full moon evening. Entrance tickets were purchased at the Tourism Office which has a parking for cars and other vehicles. Took an e -rickshaw and a tonga ( horse cart) for reaching the Taj from this point. Enjoyed the walk in the pathways and inside the majestic monument . Used the facilities of photographers available in abundance to capture some memories from the"" Diana Vantage Point"""
50,Tajmahal,Symbol of love.,Best time to visit tajmahal is in the evening. The timing of visit is accroding to moon. On purnima you can visit in the night too.
50,Tajmahal,Amazing place,"Been to world's wonder in the month of march when usually the weather is good but on that day weather was too hot. so when ever you should visit to taj mahal wear comfy clothes in layers. what should i say about the attraction, many travelers already explains it beauty. Its majestic. if you are not accompanying your loved one then you gonna miss her/him more while visiting Taj Mahal. Its such a romantic place. One more thing you should carry water bottle with you as you'll not find it there and you'll surely want to drink it because of the exhaustive walk and crowd."
50,Tajmahal,A monument which never ceases to amaze,"The Taj Mahal is one of those monuments where photos will never do justice. Located in Agra , the Taj was commissioned by Shah Jahan as a mausoleum for his wife Mumtaz Mahal. It was commissioned in 1634 and took 22 years to build. Quite a feat !!  The most ideal time to visit the Taj is early morning (5:00 summer ; 6:00 am in winter ). It's worth waking up early since you are the first people at this very busy monument. It's stunning without the crowds. Enter from any gate. High value ticket holders are eligible for a water bottle and shoe cover. You also go through a different line to enter the main mausoleum. You get great pics on the elevated platforms. Stay till sunrise."
50,Tajmahal,Sunrise is amazing!,"Try to plan a visit at sunrise but arrive at least 45 minutes early or you won't be inside before first light...wear bug repellent...the mosquitoes are ravenous at dawn. Go first to the open building on the east side of the Taj. When the sun rises, the marble sparkles like tiny diamonds...truly magical. All the photos in the world just don't do this structure justice...it's truly worth the trip."
50,Tajmahal,Beautiful,"Went to the Taj Mahal in 1989 , a beautiful place with so much history. Was there in May so it was very hot, once in a lifetime trip......"
50,Tajmahal,!st Wonder Of The World It Is.,"My friend was visiting Agra and she wanted to see Taj Mahal. It was an amazing experience, architectural wise. It is a beautiful monument and one can be amazed by the carving on the stones. If you enjoy exploring the beauty of historic, exquisite architectural work then it is a must visit place in India."
50,Tajmahal,Very Impressive,"Finally arrived here. This was on my ""list"". You really have to be here to experience the enormous beauty of this monument. It was very crowded but there were spots along the side where you can get a better camera view. In fact the picture that we took was better than the one from the ""professional"" photographer. The outside pillars had scaffolds since they were cleaning the marble. The only downside was getting inside the monument. The guard couldn't control the crowd, so there were too many people inside that it make difficult to see the tombs. And it was dark with people blocking the light from the windows. I think if you go at the end of the day it might be less crowded. You have to wear shoe coverings (booties). It's a shame to see so many used coverings on the ground when there are trash cans all round. Once in a lifetime experience."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing experience,"It is a truly magical place to visit and well worth all the effort. It was mesmerizing from the first glimpse there are neither words nor any pictures that can replace that moment. I would recommend a guide to get the best out of your visit. We booked a guide as part of a package with Deepak Kumar (you can find him on TA) before we left and we're so pleased we did. He took great care of us; the guide was knowledgeable, friendly and obviously very passionate about the subject. He knew exactly where to stand to get the best photo’s and importantly after the tour inside found us the perfect place to sit peacefully and simply enjoy the view which at sunset was genuinely captivating. The way the Taj changed from white to golden as the sun set was stunning.  On a practical note there is a strict list of what you can and cannot take inside. People were being searched during our visit so check with your guide or take a look at the Taj website for details."
50,Tajmahal,no word to explan,one of my best place ever .................. should visit by every people extremely hot between June and July
50,Tajmahal,Delightful!,"The grandeur and love expressed at this place isn't able to be put into words. The Taj, built for Mumtaz Mahal, by Shah Jahan out of his love and reverence for her empowers the true meaning of love and devotion. The craftmanship and beauty of the Taj will never be forgotten. I look forward to returning at some point in this life to experience this feeling once again."
50,Tajmahal,Forget the photos.,"I didn't want to go. I felt I'd seen it, in too many photos and films. I'd heard about the crowds. Getting there and back required a two-day effort and considerable extra expense. How could it be worth it? I went reluctantly, and only because my wife insisted.  After we passed through the lovely stone gateway -- inscribed in onyx with verses from the Koran -- and I beheld this monument to love, beauty, and grief, I stood in wonder, struck by the grace of what is perhaps the most beautiful structure ever made by humans, and tears streamed involuntarily down my face.  I've been struck dumb by other architectural wonders, but none have had the emotional impact of the Taj Mahal. Forget the photos you've seen. Don't try to capture it (although no harm in memorializing your visit). Just go and feel its gentle emotional power. But don't miss it."
50,Tajmahal,Obviously the place to go,"Great place, worth the price, make sure you bargain very hard when u want the professional pictures taken. They name the price per foto not per session. You can also insist on only digital making it cheaper and don't let them fool you with the ""we give you the CD for free"". I mean, come on do you know how much CD's cost these days?  Enjoy in the early morning"
50,Tajmahal,Just Awesome,By looking this giant building in white colour call Taj Mahal in Agra. After seen this then it make sense that why it's in World Wonder. It's feel very historical. Feel very proud to see Symbol of love.
50,Tajmahal,Simply the Best!,"Taj Mahal  What can one say about one of the world's wonders that hasn't been said. Suffice it to say it was all we expected and more. Again our guide, Rahul Singh, Incredible India by Car, was a masterful guide and photographer. Early in morning was nice so we avoided the massive crowds."
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj!,"What can be said about this place, with so much already written and documented about this. Only one thing comes in mind Wah Taj!  Make sure if you are visiting this place on weekend, reach there early morning, maybe 15 mins before the monument gets opened."
50,Tajmahal,True what they say...,"No picture will ever do this structure justice, it is mesmerising to say the least. Your first glimpse, following the story of how it was built, just take your breath away. Sadly for us 3 of the turrets are receiving renovation so it was impossible to get a photo with all turrets and the Taj without bamboo scaffolding, saying that, it didn't deter us from visiting or spoil our visit. You have to get up close to see the magnificent detail and stonework, it is truly amazing given when this was built. I will never forget the moment I first set eyes on the Taj - 1 off the bucket list!"
50,Tajmahal,It is awesome monument ...one of the 7 wonders of the world,"It is simply gr8...awesome, beautiful and symbol of divine love.Worh seeing and one of the 7 wonders of the world..a wonderful piece of engineering, craftsmenship and masonary work, almost b4 four centuries...the lavish and monarchy/dynasty living of the Moghuls...They lived Life King size...Its amazing, awesome and beautiful....A worth see for foreign tourist as well as proud Indians...Superb Architectural piece of work and craftsmenship....Simply gr8"
50,Tajmahal,2nd times to Taj,"We came to Taj Mahal after visited Pune. This is our second time, Now it's a little bit organize. The Taj Mahal look cleaner."
50,Tajmahal,Tips for Taj,"1. Take your identity card with you. Even if you are an Indian national they won't allow entry without identity card. You will have to buy expensive Rs. 1000 ticket in case of no identity card.  2. Don't carry a bag with eatables. Its not allowed no matter what you say.  3. Guides are available starting 100 till 250. They will start bargaining from 1500. We got a great one for mere Rs. 100. Having a guide helps as they know how things work there.  4. Taj is pride of India, but administration there is as horrible as it can be. So ignore negativity around Taj. Don't go with any exception on how things work around Taj. Not even a single thing around Taj is worth mentioning. I can write a book on how local government and people have destroyed the image of India and Taj."
50,Tajmahal,A loving place to visit!,"This is a great place to visit. It is magical and beautifully architect. So amazing! Tour guides are available at around INR 150-300, who may add extra real-time experience with historical story. However, you may be cheated by tour guide while ticketing and they may ask you to visit shops afterward."
50,Tajmahal,Among 7 Wonders of the World.,Monument of Love bulit by the Mughal King Shah Jahan in the memory of his beloved Wife Mumtaz Mahal.
50,Tajmahal,As beautiful up close as it is from a distance,"I visited at dawn while it was still only 90 degrees F and enjoyed a slightly more serene visit than a few hours later. Be prepared to be jostled by crowds trying to get their photos at some of the iconic spots. It is hard to stop gazing at the Taj Mahal from afar, until you get up close and look at the incredible stone-inlay work of this Taj Mahal. Each square foot is a masterpiece of artistry and craftsmanship and I could have spent the day looking at every inch of the walls. You can still enjoy the view from the shade of the surrounding gardens which are full of wildlife (parakeets, owls, monkeys, etc) and the crowds are much thinner. I had a private guide and we spent about two leisurely hours here. Warning - guards search your belongings and will confiscate any scrap of food you have, but you can carry in water."
50,Tajmahal,An iconic building!,We visited the site late afternoon but still the light on the Taj wasn't quite right to get an excellent picture. It is difficult to put into words a description of the site. The wonderful inlaid semi precious stones in the marble was something we hadn't expected
40,Tajmahal,The only person to be underwhelmed by the taj?,"Appraoching the taj is magical. The fountains are all perfectly lined up, the 4 towers are slightly leaned outwards as to not fall on the Taj if they were to fall, the underground system that holds up the taj is very ingenious for the time that it was built. The part that underwhelmed me was the interior. Its such a large structure, but the interior seemed so small. Ornate and beautiful art and craftsmanship, but small. The part that you can actually visit is about the size of my living room and then 2 more side rooms on the way to the exit that are nothing special. If you do make it all the way out there I highly recommend you get a good guide. Enjoy!"
40,Tajmahal,Great place,"This amazing place!! if you wanted to have a great experience and enjoying your time much, I would personally recommend to take a guide with you, He will make the day very valuable. Beautiful Mahal in the World."
40,Tajmahal,It was nice,"Taj is beautiful but it was very hot over there. Also we had to walk a lot and with children along with us, it was very tiring."
40,Tajmahal,Memory of india,For the first time to india quite excited but all over the india i like the place is Agra because of this historical monument.
40,Tajmahal,GREAT!,Its a beautiful architecture by the mughals and is for sure a must visit! Pls do not travel in hot weather else you will not be able to enjoy the beauty!
40,Tajmahal,Tips for international visitors,"Visited the Taj early June 2016. This is one of the wonders of the world and can be visited in a one day trip from New Delhi and back. Leave really early around 6 AM latest from New Delhi to reach there around10 AM, before the heat and the crowds. We took approx. < 2 hours from start to finish and back in the car.  The Taj is a very beautiful and spectacular monument. Must visit in this lifetime. The carvings and the architecture is amazing. Grabbing a site of the Taj at the entry is spectacular. Pictures are simply breath taking.  We visited during unbearably hot and uncomfortable weather, so next time I would dress in very light cotton attire with a cap or hat. Carry your own bottle of water per person - trust me, you will need it.  International tourists and Indians not living in India will purchase a Rs. 1000 ticket. Indians pay Rs. 40 for their ticket. You will need identification, as you may be asked for it at random. The Rs. 1000 ticket gets you in much faster, as the special queue is shorter. Plus there is no charge to use the toilet near the exit with this ticket.  Take an auto rickshaw from the ticket stand to the actual site, especially in hot, unbearable weather. Rickshaw ride costs Rs. 30 one way. Camel driven rickshaws are available, but they are slower and the heat would be too much to take.  Crowds of people wil follow you to sell goods or services. Understandable, as the people of Agra seem really very poor and they rely on tourism for their ""daily bread"", and you may have to say ""no - thank you"" repeatedly. Just go with the flow.  I would highly recommend getting a photographer and a tour guide. Most speak good English and some also speak Spanish. At the end of the visit, I received an album with my pictures and a CD for Rs. 2500, which considering the weather and all other minor obstacles in making this visit a comfortable one; this seemed to be the best investment along with the young student tour guide, Mr. Khan.  My apologies for being overly critical on this next point, but the landscaper (is there one at all?) seems to never have been through a course in landscaping. Trees lining the fountains leading up to the Taj have been blunted on top, all various shapes and sizes, really shocking and sad to see this wonder of the world situated amidst the horor of this landscaping.  Security check at the entrance did not allow me to take a newspaper and 2 books, which I had in my purse. They cited security reasons. They allowed me to take my cell phones, battery chargers, makeup case, eye glasses, and everything else - just not newspapers and books (???) for security purposes.  The facilities in and around the Taj leave you wondering if the Ministers and senior officials of the Govt. have ever taken a tour among local Indians (without special priviledges) to see how well they fare visiting the Taj.  In the inner area of the monument, it is pitch dark and crowded. There seem to be very few signs guiding people when inside the grounds of this spectacular monument, so having a tour guide is a very good idea.  Drinking water fountains and restrooms - where are they??? No signs, no directions, people have to figure it out. No official gift shops that I could see or atleast no signs pointing to them. Basics, like these amenities, are a reasonable expectation for all visitors, Indians and Intervational visitors.  After visiting the Taj, the ITC Mughal is a good place to relax, have lunch, tea or dinner; it is extremely luxurious, super clean and royal.  Other than some minor irritants, the visit was great. The Taj is one of a kind and very, very beautiful. I would highly recommend visiting it as early in the day as possible or in the evening, due to fewer crouds. Enjoy this very special experience!!!"
40,Tajmahal,One of the seven wonders,Worth the trouble to watch once in ilfe ... Avoid tour guides because they are a group of swindlers and ask you sums expensive peer tour
40,Tajmahal,My home place,This is my permanent residential city. Taj mahal I think best place in agra as well as whole india for tourists. Best way for spend time with family in agra because there is another 3 monuments.
40,Tajmahal,Beauty,"Beautiful. It was really hot on the day I went so that marred the experience a bit. Every part of teh Taj Mahal has to be savoured.....its architectural wonder...intricate carvings.....just plain beautiful.  As its a tourist spot, one does get harassed with all the touts & local vendors but i guess that has to be accepted of any tourist destination esp in India."
40,Tajmahal,Vacation,"We booked the tour of Delhi-Jaipur-Agra ,Khajuraho and Varanasi with sam tours the service overall was excellent. We had the company boys standing to greet us at all hotels before our arrival.The guide were knowledgeable and he showed us the Tajmahal. Our drivers were very expert on the Indian roads. Khajuraho and Varanasi are very different .In fact they are a sort of culture shock.The arti at the Ganges was wonderful.I certainly will recommend the Sam India Tours."
40,Tajmahal,1st visit,"looks better from a distance, up close its fairly dirty and un cared for in certain areas, they are now trying to clean it up and bring back to what it should be, they need to complete a lot of work on the grounds leading up to the entrance."
40,Tajmahal,Beware of photographers exhorbant price,"We found many photographers who charge Rs. 40/50 different size of photos. We thght we could take 10 to 15 photos. This guy took nearly 60 assuring us that we can choose.After all the photoshoot, he told a package of Rs.2500 for all. But did not allow us to choose!! So please beware"
40,Tajmahal,Wonderful attraction but long line,"Attraction was wonderful, special designed.. Was under repair during my visit in January 2016.. Long Queue of almost 3 hours make more excitement which was little bit missed when we reached inside.. Entrance fees was, 25 Rs.."
40,Tajmahal,Mesmerising. ...,"Awesome mesmerising view..I was numb to see d view of taj.mahal,so beautiful as it's name. ..we stayed at jaypee palace.so it ws merely 3 kilometer from d place approx..we reached at taj at 5.30pm .we reached till d main building bt we didn't have courage to b in d que to reach main building so we revisited it next morning ...so it's my personal advice to visit taj in early in morning on weekends. Otherwise u wl have to be in d que for approx 2 and half hour to reach finally till d main building."
40,Tajmahal,Stunning,"What can be said about the Taj that hasn't been said a thousand times before? The goosebumps you get when watching the sun rise over the palace, onto the Taj and then finally the Mosque have to be experienced to be believed. The ultimate show of love and devotion."
40,Tajmahal,Top of the list in India.,Visiting the Taj early in the morning is most advisable as the crowd is less and the weather is pleasant.
40,Tajmahal,The iconic Taj,"Taj is considered as an epitome of love but we could not get the feeling as much as it is hyped. We reached the Taj at 6 am and smoothly went through the security check. We hired a guide (for Rs 200) at the entrance only. He was very knowledgeable and good person. Dont remember his name though. Then when we entered from the door to the Taj compound, he asked us to hire a photographer. We hired as he insisted but it was a mistake. He said he will click a few important pics at good views but he started clicking pics of each and everything and each and every where to which i objected. Then he stopped a bit but still he clicked 24 pictures and asked for Rs. 40 and Rs 50 each (as he clicked two pics for every spot with different resolutions, so different rate). Then he insisted on making big frames of the pics and all that crap to which I strictly said no. Still we were looted as we negotiated at Rs 800 for four pics in hardcopy and rest in CD. When we got the printed pics at the end after we went out of the Taj, they were either diffused or we were not looking at the camera. There is a big lab where all the photographers give their memory card for developing photographs. He himself was not there when we went to collect the pics. It is a big business there. So please dont get looted by these people. This made our trip a bit saddening. But anyways, the marble carvings inside the monument are very beautiful but its not like that those are very unique. We can find them in some Jain temples, Gaitore ki chatriyan in Jaipur and Gurudwaras across the country. However, the use of stone in marble was a new thing. Some stones glow when lit up. That was amazing. But seeing its importance in World's context, the Taj is not clean. People have spitted on walls inside Taj, have thrown water bottles in the premises and ponds in front, dustbins were full from last day so shoe covers were flowing here and there in the whole compound. Means what the hell is this. People from the whole world come here and the authorities and the tourists visiting the monument cant keep it clean. What impression will the foreigners take from here? This was really saddening. However, the whole visit was OK but not an out of the world experience.  If you want to make your trip perfect then here are some tips for visiting Taj:  1. Book the ticket online as it will help save the time. Moreover, if you enter from eastern gate, the tickets are available around 750 m from the actual TAJ gate. So if you have an online ticket then you can go to the nearest possible place on the rickshaw/auto directly. But if you have to buy the ticket then either you have to again hire a rickshaw or walk the distance. 2. Visit early in the morning as there is very less rush or not at all at the security check. Again a plus point in saving time. 3. Visit during a cool weather. We went mid-May and it was sweltering hot and humid. Try to avoid it bcz if u r not comfortable then you will not enjoy the monument too. Try going in monsoons or winters when the weather is pleasant. 4. Take plenty of water as you will not get water there. There is a lone water cooler which may run empty at times. 5. There is a separate way to entrance for normal Indians and Foreigners and VIP's. Normal Indians have to remove shoes at the designated places and go barefoot while the foreigners get the shoe covers with the ticket. If one goes through the VIP area, then just before the security guard checks the VIP passes, there is a person selling the shoe covers for Rs 10-15 a pair. Buy those and enter from the side from where rest of the Indians are entering. Wear them over the shoes and save your feet from burning. 6. Get a guide if you are visiting for the first time. He will click pics also for you. We got one for Rs. 200. But it could have been less if we had negotiated. 7. The guide will try to get a photographer hired but if you remain adamant then you may not get cheated like we were. 8. If you do hire, negotiate well with the photographers. Don't let them overpower you. They will click multiple photographs, on each and every step you take. Just define the places or views you want to get clicked. 9. Check the photographs before getting them printed as ours did not click clear pics with his own camera even. 10. The guides will take you to multiple shops for showing things but don't buy from there as the guides have commission in the price. Go on your own if you wish too. You can simply avoid also as they are tooooo costly. 11. Check the price of thing in multiple shops before buying as a fridge magnet was being sold at Rs. 100 at one shop and for Rs. 50 at another. And bargain well.  If you keep these things in mind the trip would be with all good memories."
40,Tajmahal,Slightly overhyped.,"Never visit on a public holiday or on weekends. There is soo much CROWD. it will probably take 3-4 hours to enter the building. Overall it is good, but nothing is so much romantic in front to 80,000 people.(guide told us the approx. number of visitors."
40,Tajmahal,As expected,"Obviously, you need to visit the Taj Mahal, but I thought it would be bigger and more impressive. It's way more dramatic from the outside. Too bad the British stole all the jewels that were originally on the outside."
40,Tajmahal,World wonder,"We left Delhi early morning to visit Taj Mahal on Sunday. It was super packed. There are many tour guides/photographer try to get your money. If you want to use their services, please do have a price agreement in advance."
40,Tajmahal,Taj is over crowded,"Taj is uniq, but a lot of people visiting every day having probably deleterious effect on the monument. India citizen pay 30 INR and foreigners have to pay 1000 INR and SARC, BIMSTEC have pay 530 INR. This is a big discrimination among nations."
40,Tajmahal,Must see,"It's hard to visit India and not visit the taj. It's great to see, but don't miss some of the other interesting sites around Agra."
40,Tajmahal,so nice place,it so good place to see but you have to spend at least 4- 5 hours keen observiting the place and photo grafer will take more than you dicided so be care full wile takint photos first of you have to dicided how many photos you have to taken than only take the photos otherwise they will taken more photos and charge more mony
40,Tajmahal,The first wonder of Seven in the World.,Superlative craftmanship in real. A monument in Marble and precious stones. Must visit. You will be mesmerised by the sheer size and the exhibit of skill.
40,Tajmahal,Cool place.,"If you go to Agra, you have to say you saw the Taj Mahal, which is impressive but not as impressive as I expected. Cheap too, less than 5 USD."
40,Tajmahal,Pretty Amazing!,"The Taj is beautiful, just like every picture you have seen of it. I really had no idea what the insides would be, I don't think I ever even thought about it. You cannot take pictures inside. The precious stone inlay is just amazing as well as the carvings.  Of course, the crowds are amazing as well, but you can still get good pictures. Against the enormous beauty of the Taj Mahal, you almost don't notice the people in the pictures. Oh - 3 of the 4 towers were slightly covered by scaffolding, did not see anyone working.  The red sandstone fort surrounding the Taj is also very picturesque."
40,Tajmahal,“Awesome!”,"It’s bigger, more beautiful and more detailed than you could imagine. I will recommend a guide or you will miss key elements of this magnificent architectural masterpiece. It is a symbol of love and one of the seven wonders of world. I have no words but is truly mesmerizing. The Beauty of Taj was overwhelming and beyond what i had imagined or read about. It is definitely recommended and worth a visit."
40,Tajmahal,Woah,"What I really admire about this building is the architecture and effort they put in on the marble paintings and carvings. It's really an awe to have been there to see it yourself. Should visit there once at least. However shoes are not allowed inside hence I would advise getting shoe covers if you plan to visit, in case you would not like to keep your shoes lying somewhere."
40,Tajmahal,Stunning,"You have seen it many times but it is nothing until you really see it in front of you. What an amazing building. The let down is the see of vendors, guides and scammers you have to oush through to finally get inside. But then it is totally worth it."
40,Tajmahal,Recent experience at Tajmahal,"Iconic structure. No doubt you can take excellent pictures with Tajmahal in the background, to post to your contacts. Difficult to think of rating it less than excellent but some things made the experience not so satisfactory. The public is bad and the staff was on strike so this great monument was littered with the cloth shoe covers in hundreds. The access road has small, unorganised and dirty shops with poor quality merchandise. Horse carriage people keep pursuing you for patronage. Our country is not very prosperous but we can at least make surroundings of such iconic structures a little more polished."
40,Tajmahal,Our day at the Taj...,"We visited the mighty Taj Mahal in May this year. What an amazing place. We were pre warned about the touters and beggars but weren't ready for what we saw. The poverty is everywhere. Quite hard to deal with along with the smells. You need to go there with the understanding that these people are simply doing everything they can to survive. The Taj Mahal is an amazing building and truly a wonder to behold but as with almost all things Indian, it is tired and dirty. It was being renovated when we visited with lots of scaffolding. Not good for pictures but great for this mighty lady. As Europeans visitors, we were treated as somewhat of an attraction too with lots of visiting locals asking to have their photos taken with us. We didn't mind the first ten or so but the other fifty plus requests and the photo bombs annoyed us. They were mainly interested in my teenage daughters and tall blond son. I have lived in India in my youth and been back many times but this was our first visit to Agra & the Taj Mahal. My children and I enjoyed almost every second we were there. When you go, take off your expectations and let India surprise and enlighten you. You won't regret it. We meet some amazing people and visited some amazing places. If you ever need a great taxi diver with a great sense of loyalty and hummer - give Mr Khan a call and ask him to bring along his guide friend Mr Singh. They are usually waiting outside the Agra railway station to collect tourists from the Delhi in the morning and afternoon. Their English is fantastic. We hope you enjoy your visit to Agra as much as we did but hope it's not as hot for you as it was for us. While you're there, go visit the baby Taj and the foundations of the Black Taj across the river from the white one. If you can, take 45 min drive outside of Agra towards Delhi and go see the elephant sanctuary. Take your tissues - we found it very hard to learn about what these elephants have had done to them. The cruelty they have had to suffer. If was an eye opener but one well worth going too. Enjoy"
40,Tajmahal,A white marble jewelry,"Believe to be the most popular monument in India but its story is as impressive as its beauty. It was done in 22 years by over a 20,000 workers. 1000 elephants were used for marble transportation from a distance of 300 km. It's a beautiful building and very crowded, most visitors are from India. Nice and friendly people that will be happy to have a picture with you. Can find professional photographers to take pictures with you and your family, not expensive at all. For foreigners there is a separate admission line to the Taj, security checks are in place. You have to see this beauty for yourself."
30,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,"(WARNING) You can not bring your tri pod, even a small one for your iPhone into Taj Mahal. I also recommend leaving from the main entrance (where you get your ticket, for the Taj Mahal). We left through the bazar market area, where we saw what it was like for a day and life in India. First We saw a kid pooping in the street, into what look like a water drain that ran through out the market. Keep Mind they sell FOOD and flower here. The market had people frying dosas and other type of delicious India food. There was also fruit, curry and people cutting flower into necklaces, oh yea and there were LOTS OF FLYS! (Be sure to wear insect repellent) overall the Taj Mahal was a good experience it is rich in history and one of the wonders of the world. Be honest even tho it was a little sketchy maybe you do want leave through the bazar and see how it like. Maybe You'll see the world you living in a different way."
30,Tajmahal,Visit to the Taj Mahal,"I enjoyed touring India and one place I visited was the Taj Mahal. If you visit in May, you just need the right dressing as it is really HOT. Carry lots of water to drink and to wash hands. A refresher towel or wipes will go a long way. Ask for a guide so at least you understand the history of the place and how the place was built. Be prepared for crowds, it can get hectic. The building is really on the over the top with marble. Inside the place is too crowded and noisy but outside the views are beautiful with well manicured gardens."
30,Tajmahal,Overhyped,The Taj which is considered as one the seven wonders of the world when seen considers overhyped.Furst if all to reach to the place u have to park your car 1Km before because of security concerns then when u enter one has to go about rounds and rounds to find a enterence.Truely over hyped
30,Tajmahal,Badly managed Heritage property,"Being one of the seven wonders of the world, Taj Mahal lacks basic amenities for tourists.  The security is extremely rude n non cooperative, specially towards foreigners. This place is flocked by so- called guides n photographers who can turn your much awaited trip to a nightmare by constantly harassing you.  Beware of pickpockets n touted guides."
30,Tajmahal,Yeah it's Iconic but don't push me inside and blow a whistle in my ear,The Taj Mahal is magnificent. Of course you have to go if you're in the area. It's iconic and a must see. We thought the place was ok. It was great being there. We walked inside and immediately the guard was pushing me in the back and blowing a whistle in my ear (and for everyone else too). It actually was a strong push too where my head went back. I was fine though. We still went at our pace. The entire area is huge so plan to spend about 2 hours there. The Taj Mahal doesn't have great meaning to me but I'm glad I got to see it. It was great to see.
30,Tajmahal,Checked on my bucket list,"Try to visit the Taj first hour in the morning, I mean, around 6am. You will have a better light and appreciation of the monument and the gardens, besides you will avoid crowds. Try to negotiate a fixed rate with your tour guide from the beginning (around Rps. 500-600) or simply rent the audio guide (Rps. 115.) The audio guide wasn't that great though, but will give you all the time to visit at your own pace.  I cannot give the 5 stars to the Taj due to the terrible service at the Tourist Center, the poor cleanness inside of the monument (everyone dropping their shoe covers around the mausoleum and empty bottles), and the high prices for foreigners (Rps. 1,000 vs. Rps 80 for locals considering the poor service received) Be careful with scams and people trying to ""befriend you"" only to request big tips for unsolicited services at the end.  The exterior of the Taj is astounding, yes, but the scaffoldings that will be there for the next one or two years take away part of the enchant, and in my personal opinion, I was more impressed with the artwork decoration inside of the Amber Fort in Jaipur and the Golden Fort in Jaisalmer than with this mausoleum interior."
20,Tajmahal,So-so monumen,"Not sure why this monument gets so much attention with so many beautiful sites in India. Frankly I wasn't as impressed as I thought I'd be! It was about 120 degrees out so there weren't too many people there. Was saddened by the abject poverty surrounding the Taj. Even the horses used to transport visitors looked like they were going to drop dead at any second. Overall, for the amount of money that comes in through ticket sales, it's very discouraging to see the lack of infrastructure in Agra and around the Taj. It exists in so many other areas that don't have 1/10th of the visitors, so where does the income go? But what was most upsetting is that visitors refuse to follow any rules! You aren't allowed to take photos but everyone was taking selfies...in a mausoleum! You aren't allowed to linger and families were eating on the floor. You have to wear shoe covers and the guards don't bother to ask you to throw them in the bins, there are thousands of them littering the entire grounds. Very sad."
20,Tajmahal,Dirty,"It use to be a great place but its just another monument now. The long lines,people are always trying to con clients etc etc. Akshardham in Noida is much better than taj mahal"
20,Tajmahal,"Great building, rubbish everything else","Disappointing is the adjective that sums up the Taj Mahal experience.  The architecture is great, the story interesting but that is where the romantic notion stops. The whole experience is marred by the people who just don't care about anything but money, from the government to the grounds staff, no one has any sense of pride in their work, the Taj Mahal or the guests who are lining their corrupt pockets.  1000 rupees per person to go in to visit the Taj Mahal, we visited at 0600 to see the sunrise via the East Gate. Our pre arranged taxi didn't turn up, so we asked Security at our hotel (Marriott Courtyard) to call us a tuk tuk. Immediately we had a lift and for 300 rupees return, we were sorted (& cheaper than the taxi who wanted to charge double for the 3km return journey).  After buying our ticket from the booking office (approx 700m from the entrance), collecting our included bottle of water and shoe covers (which must be worn in the mausoleum) and took a rickshaw to the entrance for 100 rupees each way. We didn't try bartering with either of our two drivers as it was still cheaper than the taxi driver.  Unfortunately, opportunists are everywhere trying to get you to buy their services for a photo, their rickshaw (even though you have one), a tour, a souvenir, clothes etc. Having to repeatedly say no thank you is exhausting and frustrating, especially when you're not being listened to but just harassed.  Upon entry, you go through security, metal detectors and X-Ray for bags. Men on right, women on left side. More photographers and guides (official/unofficial you can't tell and apparently a lot of ID is fake not that I would know what I am looking at in the first place!) trying to get you to buy their services.  The view is lovely with the garden and water fountains before you leading to the mausoleum.  When you near the steps to the mausoleum, you have to put your shoe covers on (or remove your shoes altogether).  It's not the sun coming over the horizon that you see but the sun climbing up into the sky. As one should have realised, this gives a very slight yellow (golden is a bit poetic license) tinge to the marble, although the semi precious stones that are the flower art work do glint in the light.  Inside the mausoleum it is dark and difficult to see the artwork clearly.  ***Pay close attention to the rules. Only take a camera, phone and water with you. More than likely you'll be made to dispose of anything else (or go back to the booking office to store in a locker that is limited and on a first come, first served basis).  The lack of care is sad to see. There are shoe covers and water bottles disregarded all over the gardens (the majority of national people seem to think littering is acceptable), why these can't be disposed of carefully or picked up by the grounds staff (instead of them trying to point you to the ""best"" vantage point then asking for tips) is just thoughtless and lazy.  On the return, (as previously mentioned) you are harassed, however, the rickshaw and tuk tuk drivers we had were polite, courteous and reliable.  The hype of the Taj Mahal exceeds the reality. We have visited Humayun's Tomb in Delhi and the mausoleums within Lodi Gardens that are also in Delhi that are equally beautiful if not quite as well renovated.  Yesterday we took said taxi that let us down this morning to the other side of the Yamuna river for a view at sunset for 600 rupees return. 200 rupees each to get into Mehtab Burj (ruins of a supposed planned black Taj Mahal for emperor Shah Jahan) so that we could see the Taj Mahal as the sun set. It was ok but didn't ""WOW"" us.  My advice is to read up on the history before you go rather than hire a guide and save yourself 1000 rupees.  Good luck!"
20,Tajmahal,beautiful building in a terrible city,"The politicians in Agra are reputed to be among the most corrupt in India and despite receiving a great deal of money in tourism revenues, no money has been spent in improving the infrastructure of that city. Getting into the Taj is a problem as there were queues at the main gate stretching back for two hours. There is another gate and one of the local ""guides"" presuaded us to part with a day's salary and take us to this entrance. No mobile phones are allowed inside and have to be left in the office. The monument is very busy inside and you need to watch your purse carefully. The grounds have been landscaped and are quite pleasant to sit in and take a break from the heat, dust and the beggars and touts outside. The Taj Mahal is really suffering from age, neglect and pollution. The standard photos in books and post cards are very old and deceiving. I do not think it was worth it and I would recommend staying elsewhere and going over to see the Taj as an afternoon excursion. Better yet, take the one day return trip from New Delhi and don't stay in Agra at all. The color of the Taj is not good, it is chipped up and crumbling, and everyone seems to be in denial about how the neglect is effecting the beauty of this architectural wonder. I was shocked and very disappointed and saddened."
20,Tajmahal,Terribly organized,"I regret to write this for our very own wonder which looks more like a disaster now. Soon this place would need disaster management on place of ASI. There is ZERO security check. no hygiene, visitors sitting in the garden filling water from gardening pipes. people running and pushing to go past the crowd (high signs of a stampede) No control on the crowd, people could be seen walking with footwear ON and no show covers. Exit looks like a garbage collection with show covers thrown everywhere. No organized arrangement of battery vehicles to operate, the one who can runs faster can grab it. Battery vehicles could be seen parked in the garden and not operating coz its sunny for them to drive. ZERO management control, touts seems to dominate the area for everything leaving travellers to their mercy."
10,Tajmahal,very poor arrangements from Govt.,"avoid visiting in afternoon. & summer people there just making money from visitors the camera man, riksha wale, guide everyone is lying to tourists & making money & local govt. has no idea what is happening not at all good arrangement for the tourist as they are aware its being summer holiday lakhs of people visiting the TAJ Mahal but there no water available to drink only one water station where you will have thousand people in Que"
45,Tajmahal,Does Not Disappoint!,"I don't know how anyone could give this less than 5/5. I didn't expect to be as good as everyone says it is, but it is very beautiful. Definitely worth going early to watch the sunrise!  Only small bits of advice: - Be careful walking to it, it is very busy and a lot of people take interest in you.  - Don't take a Bag. They won't let you in and then it's a bit of a Treck and expensive (relatively) to store your belongings."
45,Tajmahal,Golden Triangle Tour,"We had our trip organised in within a week by crab tree india travels and Hari Mangal was the person who organised it. They were efficient, friendly, professional, our safety always came first. Our Driver Vishnu was so knowledgeable about India and a great driver which is just what you need in India!!!! we started our tour in Delhi, few to Udaipur and travelled back to Delhi via Jaipur, Chittorghar, and Agra. It really was an amazing experience and if you want to do this tour with a trustworthy company I would highly recommend Hari Mangal and Vishnu as a driver. Our hightight was Taj Mahal at sunset very hard to describe in words how beautiful it is."
45,Tajmahal,amazing place,this is the amazing place to visit. It is very beautiful. I enjoyed here with friends. there was huge crowd but visit was good.
45,Tajmahal,Wonder of the world !,Indeed a wonder of the world. Can't describe the beauty in words. It was very well kept and maintained. It is like a gem in between the beautiful n historical city.
45,Tajmahal,The taj mahal,My visit to the taj was absolutely amazing. Cheep and more than worth seeing! It's an incredible unforgettable experience and I highly recommend to anyone to visit.
45,Tajmahal,Perfect place for faMily and freinds hangout,The beauty as we know is historic and the reason for its building makes the place perfect for couples and family
45,Tajmahal,Stunning beyond all expectations!,"We visited this amazing monument recently and were blown away by the experience! What added immeasurably to our experience in touring The Golden Triangle was the exceptionally good services afforded us by Tailored Travel (South Africa) and Yatrik Tours and Travels (New Delhi). The 10-day guided tour we went on went like clockwork - all very well planned and carried out. Our guides for the tour were very good and the guide for the Agra leg of our tour, Mr Lalit, was excellent!"
45,Tajmahal,Truly a wonder... Mesmerizing !!,"Taj Mahal's beauty is mesmerizing that will leave any tourist spellbound and in awe of it.... The sprawling gardens in front of the monument with beautiful trees and long queue of fountains with flowing Yamuna river in the backdrop is a sight to behold with unparalleled beauty... The best time to visit Taj Mahal would be during winters as it tends to get pretty hot in summers. Since one has to take off the shoes before going inside the monument, it will be hard to walk in summers on the hot marble floor.."
45,Tajmahal,Loved it,What an amazing monument! The Taj was getting renovated and it was incredible to see the original families working on the tiles and using techniques from 100's of years ago. Our tour guide was a wealth of information and gave us access to the tomb which is not open to the public.
45,Tajmahal,Stunning,"There is nothing written that can prepare you for a first sight of this beautiful building.  Go early morning to beat the arrival of the tour buses.  Ignore the attempts to persuade you that you have to have a guide.  Be aware that any food stuff, cigarettes, or water will be taken from you at security.  If possible go to the other side of the river as the view of the building, especially at sunset, is worth the effort."
45,Tajmahal,All the majesty you expect,"This UNESCO World Heritage listed site, is famous throughout the world for its stunning architecture and it's symbolic nature as a monument to Love. The sight of the Taj in person does not disappoint. Rather, it surpasses expectation, with its beautifully conceived gardens, admirably juxtaposed ante buildings (the red stone of the mosque and guest house) and the ethereal white stone of the central tomb takes on a beautiful mystical aspect at dawn on a foggy winter's morning."
45,Tajmahal,Beautiful place....,Beautiful place. Neat and clean. Security is good. You may find long queue. Must visit in night. Thumbs up....
45,Tajmahal,Amazing place,Visited after a long drive from Jaipur. This monument is great. There is a very nice atmosphere and the architecture detail is superb. Highly recommended.
45,Tajmahal,Just perfect,Busy as you would expect but beautiful and surprisingly quiet in the shaded tree lined avenues.Well worth the visit quite small inside and very hot too.
45,Tajmahal,One of the wonders of the world,"Breathtaking mausoleum. We went in December when it was rather foggy in the morning due to the nearby rivers. I recommend that you visit in the afternoon. The place will be heaving with people, selfie stick sellers and posers but at least you can have a clear view of this breathtaking monument."
45,Tajmahal,Breath taking!,"The Taj Mahal is amazingly beautiful. This place is breath taking and words cannot describe its beauty. Very well kept and maintained. However the staff there are tooo rude, not helpful, least intrested in assisting guests. To add on to that inside the premises there are soo many photography hawkers who make the entry unpleasant."
45,Tajmahal,Love Expressed in Art and Marble,"What can you say about the Taj Mahal that hasn't already been said? Even if you've read about it, walking through the East Gate and seeing the Taj gleaming in the garden takes your breath away. The proportions are so perfect, it seems to float. We were there at dawn, watching the lambent light strengthen so the colours of the marble and pietra dura become more intense. The proportions, the prayer around the main door, the balance of the minarets, the detail of the sculptured marble flowers or the marble screens, carved from a single piece of stone....I'm babbling, but that's what this site reduces me to. It's beauty is beyond words. You have to see it yourself. One practical piece of advice: if you go at dawn, take mosquito repellant."
45,Tajmahal,Beautiful,One of the seven wonders of the world...and rightly so A must visit if a lover of art and architecture.. Get a guide to see you through the property... There's lots to learn and tons of moghul history...
45,Tajmahal,awesome,an amazing and emotional experience witnessed at sunrise.our guide new all the best place to get the great pictures. the minarets were being repaired and were surrounded by scaffolding however this didn't detract from the experience. (next year the main building will be undergoing maintenance so this might change the view)
45,Tajmahal,Wah TAJ,"you can talk about the Taj Mahal for hours. A beautiful monument built by a river side. You need a good guide to explain the architecture of this wonderful structure. Well maintained both in the inside and the outside, this is must visit place if you live in India or if you visit India. Everything here is symmetrical and perfect. you can stay around it for hours and yet you will not get bored looking at it."
45,Tajmahal,Night view,I was looking that i reached agra when it was open for night view also. Yes its expensive to watch in night but its worth of money. Its look so romantic in night time.
45,Tajmahal,A must-see for all travelers!,"We were actually there the same day as William and Kate, although we chose to visit at sunrise. Make sure you take your bug spray because the mosquitoes are fierce at that time of the day! You can also visit a city park on the other side of the Yamuna River and see the Taj Mahal from the rear. That's an interesting place to go at sunset. It's just a short tuk-tuk ride to get there."
45,Tajmahal,How romantic,Sitting where Lady Diana sat embracing the ambience and romance of this wonderous structure.... ode to be loved and have this built for me... well half would do really
45,Tajmahal,needs better management by Taj authority and the restrictions/rules about backpack/food items should be well advertised,"Taj gate opens at 6 AM, but the cloak room at the ticket counter opens at 8 AM,They do not allow backpacks but allow small hand held bags for security reasons. Especially they do not allow Back packs until cloakroom opens at 8 AM which is near ticket counter 1/2 mile away from Taj E gate. There is transport from car park/ticket counter to Taj E gate, Rs 10. So if you go before 8 AM leave backpacks/food/video at the cloakroom. Water bottle, folding umbrella, is allowed., Also, water fountains are started after 8 AM which is a bad thing to tourists who go to see Taj before 8 AM.. Tickets have to be bought and used same day. Full moon night viewing of Taj is allowed to limited people with few restrictions, 1-2 days on either side of full moon. Check website of UP tourism for the dates. Closed on Fridays. Lighting along the approach road is very bad and needs changing. It is dark on either side at nights and needs sorting urgently."
45,Tajmahal,Majestic,Most things appear less beautiful as you move closer to see them. Not quiet so with the Taj. It is indeed a wonder worth watching.
45,Tajmahal,Dream come true!,I have wanted to visit the Taj Mahal since early childhood - This majestic beauty did not disappoint! We visited at opening time and enjoyed the sunrise and cooler temperatures - and a much smaller crowd! Plan to spend a few hours to take in the details of this extraordinary work of art!
45,Tajmahal,Incredible Taj Mahal,"Without a guided tour, you are missing out on an experience of a lifetime. We had Ashish Gupta as our guide who made the experience out of this world."
45,Tajmahal,Awesome place,"I really liked the visit. I recommend to plan to arrive the night before to Agra, stay in a hotel close (we stayed at Radisson Blu which is not expensive and within walking distance to the gate). You should really wake up early and be at the gate at 6:00 am (or even 15 mins before). I'm not a early bird but was really happy because even at that time you will find a lot of people, but nothing compared to a later time. In some of my photos i even managed to leave tourists out. You will spend around 2 hours in the visit so you can come to the hotel afterwards to have breakfast and relax. Big bags are not allowed. I briught my bag with lenses for photography and had to carry them in my wife's purse because the backpack was not allowed inside. Preferably bring just your camera without the bag, unless it is a small one. Leave everything in the hotel as there's no place to store your things while you go inside. If you are already in the security area, you will have to walk a long way to find where to keep your rejected bags (eg: a shop at the entrance). It's really frustrating. The rules for photos are also strict and somewhat silly. You cannot take photos jumping with the Taj Mahal in the background nor wearing shirts with publicity or the like. Regardless of this, you will enjoy it. It's an impressive place."
45,Tajmahal,Words and photos cannot describe the Taj Mahal!,"Incredible, massive, beautiful, hypnotic, amazing... It is almost impossible to describe the outstanding beauty of this incredible place. Much bigger than we thought, the grandeur and superlatives grow as you hear the story behind it and walk towards it. This is one of life's great experiences."
45,Tajmahal,Beauty under reconstruction,we were visiting the wonder of the world this weekend...its started loosing its shine but still with less vehicles allowed around it..somehow the beauty is still trying to be preserved..we went at 4.30 pm got a photographer arranged and got 2 of our photos developed for 40Rs each. we re sceptical initially but then the guy turned out to be a honest one..it was not very crowded..it was a full moon day we were not aware else you had the option of viewing it (late night) but on a separate booking the earlier day (check the website)..well maintained..but one big complaint..there are shoe covers available (Rs 10 each from the shops outside of a very poor quality)..please wear them or walk bare foot to preserve the nature..and when you throw the shoe covers please DO THEM IN DUSTBIN..there are boards everywhere but still people tend to just throw it...imagine your house being a dumpyard will you ever do it...Swach bharat.(CLEAN INDIA).Just carry bottle of water only that is allowed rest will be thrown out..
40,Tajmahal,India sightseeing,"A must see experience, an early start to see the sunrise was well worth it and it added to the serene atmosphere of this monument. So beautiful"
40,Tajmahal,Must see,A must see if you go to India. Grounds were clean and well care for by staff. We took a day tour to avoid getting to and from the train station.
40,Tajmahal,Awesome,"I did wonder whether I would be disappointed, given my high expectations. This was not the case. A wonderful building, in beautiful gardens, with plenty to see. Visiting inside the tomb was rather like being in a market place, with jostling crowds, noise and guards. But the exterior lived up to expectations. Entry fee R1000, and worth ever rupee. Don't miss the Mosque to the side of the Taj itself, and there is a small museum."
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,"What an amazing place, still can't believe we made it there. Scaffolding around the minarets during our visit, but it was still very beautiful and well worth the time it took for us to get there by road."
40,Tajmahal,The Fulfillment Of A Lifetime Wish,"The Taj mahal has to be one of the greatest buildings ever built. I knew about that simple statement before I went and my expectations were high, high, high. No disappointment either when seen in the flesh. Majestic. Inspirational. Unique. One of the greatest testaments to mans love for another. My wife and I are immeasurably richer for having seen this simply outstanding example of architecture and love. I can get another buzz just by thinking about it. Look for the many details that show the fascinating workmanship apart from the world class architectural detailing, such as the hand carved inlays and flowers. The proportions of the form are exquisite. It is impossible to describe in words how wonderful a temple this is. It has to be top of your bucket list."
40,Tajmahal,Just Beautiful !,"Just remarkable structure ! White marbles with inlay stones with yellow marble, jasper and jade of the walls. It's beautiful that captures the moment and holds it for life.  Not to mention the facility given by Indian Railway by using the fastest train in the country, Gatimaan Express which takes about 100 minutes to cover 188 kilometres at a speed of 160 km/h ."
40,Tajmahal,Really massive and beautiful marble building,When you hear about how it is built it gets even more admirable. It's just a building but it has so much history and beauty in it. It has amazing garden in front of it and is sacred. Visited in June 2012 so it was low season and very hot but less people there which was good. It's made very expensive for tourists compared what local pay for it (like 20 times or sth) but it is still worth visiting and it's still cheap because it's India.
40,Tajmahal,the most amazing place i have ever seen.....,"Taj-Mahal is one of the 7 miracle of world.This beautiful mosque located in Agra,India which bulid by Shah Cahan for his wife in 17 century.I suggest to everyone this place who wants to get an amazing impression...."
40,Tajmahal,A real Wonder of the world,The place is so good in the morning . It s just mesmerizing. kept quite clean by the govt. of India. Entry fees is quite fair. No need of a guide. But do get lots of photos.
40,Tajmahal,The best natural wonder - I have seen a few others,"Perhaps slightly greyer in the last decade due to inevitably pollution. The roads and cleanliness are atrocious. If the Taj weren't there, I sincerely believe no tourist will ever go to Agra  As for the monument - history tell it all. Simply fabulous!"
40,Tajmahal,Simply Mesmerising!,"By staying at the Oberoi Hotel we woke to views of this majestic wonder from our room. Though it was the hot season, we got to The Taj early to get great photo opportunities, beat the crowds and survive the heat."
40,Tajmahal,A teardrop on the cheek of eternity,"The Taj Mahal - Call it the way you like -The epitome of love -The ultimate expression of love -An elegy in marble -An expression of a dream  All these will come later. When you see the monument for the first time from the impressive decorative gateway's arch, it will leave you speechless. As you approach it a million thoughts go through your mind and if your are fortunate, will make you reach out for the hand of your partner. The Taj is a place you must visit if you have fallen in love even for a moment in your life.  The Taj Mahal was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in the memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal who died in 1631 at the age of 38. She was initially buried in the garden of Zainabad, he body was finally enshrined in the crypt of the main tomb of the Taj Mahal. Shah Jahan lived out the last decade of his life, till his death in 1666, as a prisoner in Agra Fort. He spent his days gazing across the Yamuna river to the monument he had built in memory of his lost love.  When Shah Jahan died, his son Aurangzeb had him entombed beside his beloved Mumtaz Mahal. There they rest, united by death, never to be parted again. The four sides of the Taj Mahal are perfectly identical creating an astonishingly mirrored image on each side. It uses the principles of self-replicating geometry and symmetry of architectural elements. Shah Jehan's tomb is the only element that is not replicated.  Taj Mahal was constructed over a period of twenty-two years, employing twenty thousand workers. It was completed in 1648, 22 years after the work started. Over a 1,000 elephants were put to work on the construction site, to lift, carry and transport logs, blocks of marble and any other material that was required across the construction site.  The architecture of the Taj Mahal is a combination of Indian, Persian and Islamic styles of architecture. The four minarets of the Taj Mahal have been constructed to taper away from the monument, so that in case the minarets fell, they would fall away and not on the main structure.  At different times of the day the Taj Mahal appears to be in a different colour. Legend says that these changing colours depict the changing moods of a woman. We were fortunate to view it on a full moon night, it appeared like a white jewel silhouetted against the dark sky. One is not allowed to carry mobiles and only still camera's are allowed, which turned out to be a blessing as the small group which is allowed at night had nothing to distract itself and allowed the magical image to soak in. This will be imprinted on your mind and will last a lifetime."
40,Tajmahal,One of the Modern Wonders of the World,"You cant explain to people who havent been there how compelling this building is to the eye. It has something magic about it, whether it be in late afternoon or as you wait at sunrise to capture the Monument. Built with love by Mughal Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife Mumtaz the building seems to have captured this tremendous devotion and radiates these feelings to all who visit. You can literally sit there for hours just thinking or just looking and it will be in your heart forever. We have been married for over 50 years but it was a joy to be there together."
40,Tajmahal,What can I say?,Its one of the wonders of the world for a reason. We went with a guide which was smart b/c not only did he take pictures of us but he was able to thoroughly explain the history of it very well! Its magnificent to see in person - - it looks different at different times of day which is pretty cool! Plus there are lots of monkeys running around which I had a lot of fun watching a well! Its one of those places you have to see in person! If you go -- remember its not open on Fridays- so plan accordingly!
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful!,"I can see why this place is one of the wonders of the world. The architecture is amazing! Its almost impossible to believe that the Taj Mahal was built 400 years ago, when they had no modern technology. The building itself is decorated with beautiful jewels. Two of the best times to go are morning and evening, as there's less crowds, its cooler and you get to enjoy the beautiful sun rise or sun set. Definitely worth the visit!"
40,Tajmahal,What More Needs To Be Said?,"Just add my vote - this is one of the dozen MUST SEE structures on Earth. More than a mausoleum, more than a building, more than an architectural joy, it is the PLACE that impresses. Go in the early morning, return in the evening to catch the late sun light on the white marble. Heavenly!"
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,Taj Mahal one of the best monument to visit in India most of travllers wants to visit Taj Mahal in his India Holidays Trips
40,Tajmahal,How can you not see the Taj iif you are in Agra right?,"Unbelievable. It's massive, hot and plenty of crowd. We went with a guide which I highly recommend. Our tour agent did a real good job organizing our trip to Agra and Rajasthan."
40,Tajmahal,A Real Wonder of the World - Waiting to be admired...Forever.,"With thousands of reviews pouring, exclusive media coverage and elaborate documentaries to its name, The Taj Mahal is a standing testimony of sheer perfection and symmetry. Aptly justifying the most coveted title of “One of the Seven Wonders of the World”, this man-made structure proudly bespeaks of grandeur and magnificence, while never shying from exhibiting a glimpse of what ‘Paradise’ just might look like. An attempt of Shah Jahan to bring a slice of that cosmic imagination to ground has resulted into such an enchanting experience that it never fails to bewitch its admirer. A cast is spelled, eyes are glued – emerging from Earth and piercing high into the blue sky, The Taj shows how a vacant space of nothingness can be turned into a scene of awe and inspiration. Just the silhouette of The Taj is enough to mesmerise its onlookers.  Located in Agra, the image of Taj Mahal has time and again represented India on a global scale. Grandly enshrined between the high sandstone walls on its three sides, the backside of The Taj is guarded by the meandering Yamuna River. On approach from three walled gates, first-timers will be surprised to find the Taj missing! The construction of the entire complex (yes, Taj Mahal is an entire complex and not just the tombstone itself) has been done in an illusionary way, in red sandstone, so that viewers can’t see it at the first glance. This has been done to create anticipation, an urge to see The Taj as soon as possible. A structure of this fame deserves to command the said anticipation, and the transitionary visual affect from deep dark red to pure marble white is the end product of this wait.  The massive Taj appears out of nowhere once the high arched sandstone gate is reached. Be ready to jostle your way through the crowd as this is a tourist favourite picture spot. Patient and slow movement is what is needed to admire this wonder of the world. Take a few moments of calmness, and gaze at the pure white exuberance. The crowd inside the compound can sometimes make this experience a bit sour, but one can’t help it, as everyone is as eager as everyone to taste a slice of ‘Paradise on Earth’. Don’t just see, observe. Observation is the key to feel the presence of Taj Mahal. Observe how the fountains are inch perfectly laid; how the gardens have been symmetrically designed. But out of everything, observe how on earth someone could have constructed a dome that perfect. The beauty of The Taj lies in scale and symmetry. Tiny insects are we in front of its enormity. As you approach the main structure, keep observing how exponentially the mass of the structure gains weight over your sight. Mid-way is a raised square platform cladded in white marble. This platform is specifically for photo and selfie enthusiasts as some of the best angles on camera can be achieved from this spot. But do expect heavy crowd on it. The base of The Taj is a high raised square platform, and the main tomb can only be reached through the stairs inside this platform. The size of this entrance gate and stairs make it evident that originally the main tomb was not intended for public visits. It was Shah Jahan’s personal memorabilia of his wife Mumtaz Mahal and private emotional visits is what he envisioned The Taj for. Unfortunately the old emperor was later locked inside the Agra Fort by his own son, and from there he would only be able to gaze and never visit The Taj.  A long queue to the stairs awaits you. Summers can be killing as the sandstone surface at the bottom of The Taj heats up like anything. Once up the platform, The Taj stands sky high in front of you. The urge to touch the marble gets very high. Keep on the laid carpet path, as the marble below it will be boiling under the scorching sun. I prefer visiting Taj Mahal during the closing hours, when the sun is low. This close to the structure, one can’t help but get lost in the intricate details on the walls. Precious stones have been used to decorate the floral patterns throughout. It takes a while to gauge the mammoth amount of human labour and will-power it took to carve such intertwined details. The fact that there were no machines available during those days, the smooth flat surface finish of each marble slab holds your imagination halted in awe. Before entering the main tombstone, take a while to circumscribe through it. Look for different illusions that have been cleverly carved throughout the structure (a guide might come handy for this activity). High rising arches on the four sides of the octagonal plan of Taj makes one look tiny.  On entrance to the main tomb area, expect to be pushed and pulled by the ever growing crowd. This can’t be helped as the innards are too good to be left at a glance. Though there is no artificial light inside the tomb, recessed sunlight makes it bright. The tomb in the centre is pseudo as the original tomb of Mumtaz Mahal peacefully rests in the crypt. Surrounded by a mesh of very minutely carved vertical marble slabs, the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal is accompanied by the tomb of Shah Jahan. This second tomb is larger in size and is the only thing in the entire compound that follows no symmetry. The linear aligned fountains, the huge arched sandstone entry gate, the tip of the dome – everything is in perfect symmetry with the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. It seems like for Shah Jahan, his entire world started with Mumtaz. Legends tell the ornate marble wall was originally supposed to be made of gold. I find myself immensely satisfied and awe-struck by the current setup. The details are unlike anything you have seen before. It is really tough to move out of the central tomb area that soon, as the security personnel commands the crowd to do so.  There are two other sandstone building on either side of Taj Mahal. One is a mosque, and the other has been (presumably) built to maintain symmetry. The garden on the other side of river Yamuna adds to the beauty of Taj. Agra Fort is visible from the backside, and deserves a visit of its own. One can easily gauge the extensive landscape planning that must have undergone to bring the cosmic imagination of Taj Mahal into life.  History regarding the origin of The Taj is well-known around the world. Some call it the greatest symbol of love ever created while others call it a sign of oppression on the laborers who built it. We can only speculate and never know the exact state of mind in which Shah Jahan envisioned this grand project. It’s unquestionable that love for Mumtaz Mahal drove his passion, but whether this passion transformed into craze and obsession or not is something that is still debatable. Whatever might have been the driving force behind its creation, The Taj is standing strong to the test of time. Unfortunate that visitors today have to experience a somewhat ‘brownish-yellow’ Taj, as the pollution levels near the structure has alarmingly altered the pure white marble. This makes me wonder, whether we truly deserve The Taj or not. But since time has already taken its course, and mankind has been gifted with one of its greatest prized possession, all we can do is play our own parts to the survival of this magnificent tombstone. I hope that more efforts are made to keep Agra clean and Taj Mahal ever shining.  To the people who are reading this review, I will do injustice to The Taj if I recommend or not recommend it. The fame itself is sufficient in convincing people to visit it at least once in their lives. Since we live once, I wonder what I would have missed if I were to not see The Taj. Pictures, documentaries, reviews – all of it do injustice to this ‘Sign of Love’. Visit the Taj to feel how spatial engulfment casts spell on you. Visit the Taj to visualise what magnificence, symmetry and perfection means. Visit the Taj to see what passion can do. And finally, visit The Taj to experience what The Taj is!"

40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,"Sheer poetry in white, an ode to love.. the monument in white stands proud in all its glory, and is a must see for all those seeking beauty in the ancient.. We visited the Mahal in April which is not the most ideal time of the year to visit due to extreme climatic conditions. April to July, I suppose can be avoided for this very reason. We reached Taj as early as 6 am just before it could get uncomfortably hot - it is recommended that at least during the summers one try and cover as much before the clock strikes 10am. A good three hour span from 6 to 9 am should offer sufficient insight and coverage of the Taj. It appears that the opening time depends on dawn and dusk, the door opens at dawn and closes at dusk. The entry cost INR 40 for Indians who can produce proof of address in India such as Adhar Card or original passport. For those who are not able to produce this, can get an entry for INR 1000/- per person. The ticketing counter do not accept PAN card. You can travel upto the Ticket station in car and from there on by walk to the entrance of the Taj which is located around 1km from the ticketing station. You can also opt for battery operated vehicles (INR 10/- for Indians and free for INR 1000/- ticket) or cycle rickshaw (Tanga) which costed us INR 50/- per way although the costs may vary as per season). There are guides aplenty around the Taj, and it recommended that you book one through a good agent or at least go in for those who are able to prove their legitimacy via registered licence."
40,Tajmahal,Really a wonder,One gets mesmerised to see it for the first time.Huge and beautiful.view from the far is too good.It's better to read about it prior to going or have a guide as the work done inside is amazing.Beautiful work with colours done by Mughals. In summers it will be too hot.
40,Tajmahal,Direct from the airport and back.,"There are tons of reviews on the Taj. Here is what I would add. If you are thinking of going direct from the Delhi airport and coming back the same day. No issue. Drive is really not that bad on the toll road. We left landed at 9:30 went, saw, ate. Quick marble Shopping and back at our hotel in Delhi at 8:30. Tired but nothing a shower and drink by the pool did not fix."
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal - Agra,"ONe of the true wonders of the world. An engineers dream with the symmetry of the structure. In terrific shape. Get the delux ticket that includes water and shoe coverings. Ignore all the vendors selling pictures, advice as to where to take pictures, etc. Just enjoy the beauty of the building."
40,Tajmahal,Abosulutely mind blowing,"One of the World Wonders, seeing the Taj Mahal with my very own eyes was absolutely mind blowing. The history, design, and architecture of this monument was fascinating. Also surrounded by beauty all around. One can look at photos on the internet, or photos from friends who had visited India, but one MUST see this with their own eyes to really appreciate this."
40,Tajmahal,my first trip to taj mahal agra fatherpur sikri jaipur ranthambore,"I was very impressed by this travel company's personal service and follow through. During the planning process, my agent spent considerable time (at his off hours) discussing our objectives.  This India travel agency provided excellent customer service throughout the entire process. Everyone I dealt with was pleasant and they took care of everything imaginable. The tour went exactly as planned and the tour guides were friendly, knowledgeable and extremely accommodating. I would highly recommend this company incredible india journeys."
40,Tajmahal,Exceptionally Beautiful,Seeing the Taj Mahal in real life is nothing like seeing it in pictures. The monument is absolutely stunning and definitely one of my favourite tourist attractions. It's a bit annoying to get in with people pushing you and with it being so crowded but it's definitely worth it. I was pretty unlucky to go when they had begun the restoration process to the tiles so sadly I had scaffolding that ruins my pictures. I don't recommend getting a guide to take you around. Instead just read up on the history and you should be fine.
40,Tajmahal,Symbol of Love for Lovers,"Most of them, but not all, In ancient history there were wars between countries due to Female (Girl) for Love or Beauty or Attraction or Sex.  If you have seen TajMahal, By now you might have understood why those wars were happened.  The beauty of expressing a love has no limits……”Taj Mahal”."
40,Tajmahal,Impressive and Beautiful,"The architecure, details, and beauty of this impressive monument is one of a kind. We had our own tour guide and he made it a little easier for us to get through. We still had to go through the crowd and the security lines are separately from women and men. It is preferible not to bring a bag/purse because then you'll have to collect it at the end of the security line and it could be chaotic. Once inside, there are many corrupted and annoying ""official photographers""."
40,Tajmahal,What a beauty,What can i say about this monument which has not already been said. Let me try and post a few tips. 1. No books / novels are allowed inside so either don't carry them with you or leave them at a shop around the premises. 2. If you don't get a shuttle from the parking then it is a fairly long walk about 1.5 km so wear comfortable shoes. 3. Please buy the shoe covers else you will need to take off your shoes. 4. Please use the toilet at the parking lot / ticket counter as there are no facilities at the monument.
40,Tajmahal,what you expect,Met the high expectations. Beautiful place. Worth to have a guide to show you all the small amazing details. Went on Saturday morning. Guide recommended to go 6.30 (opens at 6) which seemed to be a good time. No queue and not yet that crowded.
40,Tajmahal,The Most Beautiful Building,This is certainly one of the must see buildings in the world. Try to go really early in the morning so you can better enjoy walking around the Taj without the crowds. The scale of the building though allows you to enjoy it regardless and the white stone surfaces reflect both sunrise and sunset beautifully.
40,Tajmahal,The Taj Mahal is the tears of love on the cheek of time.,"The architect Ustad Isa designed and constructed the Taj Mahal (prounounced Ma-HAL', like the man's name) which means the jewel in the crown. It is an immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra, India between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal who died in childbirth with his 16th child. Our guide confirmed it was the 16th child that killed her during a breach birth. The Taj Mahal is one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage. It employed 22,000 laborers to build and was designed to resemble the offspring of a square and an octagon. A square for the most part, its corners are angled. The eight sides of the mausoleum are graced with magnificent arches, towering structures that support the enormous weight of the tear-shaped dome. There are thousands of carved flowers adorning the walls, delicate forms of lily, iris, tulip and narcissus. The petals and leaves are perfectly configured; the flowing vines connecting the flowers. You gaze at lapis from Afghanistan, jade from China and Burmese amber. There are pearls and coral from the Indian coast, as well as jasper, green beryl, onyx, agate, amethyst and quartz from the Indian interior. The Taj Mahal's main room floor is comprised of patterns of black marble set within the white. The dome is pure white marble, as are the minarets. You want to trace the marble flowers with your fingers and palms it is so stunning. What is so spectacular is the entrance at the south main gate which is made of red sandstone. Every few feet you walk towards the entrance it is like the veil lifted from a beautiful woman's face, you see more and more until it is revealed and you are standing in the outstretched ornamental gardens. Since the Qur'an described four rivers flowing within Paradise, Isa had decided to mimic Paradise's loveliness by using two intersecting channels of water to create four identical sections of land. In the center of the four squares sits a a round pool, made of white marble and often containing koi. The surrounding plots of land have cypress and fruit trees where a plethora of flowers bloom. So where does the name come from? Remembering that his wife's name was Mumtaz Mahal, Mumtaz turned to Taz as the years passed. Then she was simply known as Taj. It is totally worth the travel effort; the lines, the ticketing, the vendors, the beggars outside the Taj Mahal, but inside is a place of beauty and wonderment almost beyond words. I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Hope you will too. PS: have your picture taken on the marble bench in front of the Taj pools where Prince William and Kate did last week. Priceless!"
40,Tajmahal,Simple breathtaking,"Simply breathtaking. Now matter how beautiful your imagination may have you believe this is, in reality it is far far beyond. The building reflects the light with a wonderful luminescence, you literally cannot take your eyes of it as you walk towards it. Bring water and a hat, you will be outside in the heat for some time, as it is hard to leave. Come early to avoid the worst of the crowds."
40,Tajmahal,It Was Everything I Hoped,"This is the symbol of India for most of us and it was worth the visit. We went early in the morning and were lucky that the air was pretty clear that day so we had a great visit. Even though it was early, it was extremely crowded with both Indian and foreign tourists. The next day the air was so hazy that we couldn't see it across the street."
40,Tajmahal,Celebrating World Heritage day at Taj,Happy and lucky to be at Taj on World Heritage day along with my love Nidhi it was day where all the visitors were guest to this beautiful monument there was No entery charge World's number one wonder no doubt when you see words the monument you say Wha ! Taj
40,Tajmahal,The Taj Majal,"Having been there four times over 38 years, it seems that now it is the most attractive that I have seen. I was there in November which is a good time since it wasn't too hot. As one has to remove one's shoes upon entering the tomb, the marble floor can be very hot in the spring and summer even with foot coverings which they supply. Most people are not aware of the intricate and beautiful flowers which cover the walls of the white marble building made with inlaid semi precious stones, orange jasper, green malachite, blue lapis, etc. These are the most attractive to me since the graceful flowers seem to do a dance on the walls. Another option is to view the Taj from the other side of the Yamuna River at sunset. Another beautiful sight."
30,Tajmahal,The Taj Mahal,"I set up my tour through viator.com in advance and chose the one day tour. We got to New Delhi later in the day which gave us time to adapt to the time. The tour started at 5 am for the drive down to Agra. We chose to drive instead of the bullet train because of the time getting back to the hotel. If you take a car, you get back sooner. Our driver, Sushil, met us at the hotel with a smile. You will need a driver or take the train because it is not an option to drive if you are a foreigner. Be prepared for the ride because it will be very stimulating in the cities: not so much on the highway. It takes about 3.5 hours to drive to Agra. We went to the Baby Taj first to pick up our tour guide, Pramod Kumar Arora. He bought the tickets there for all the attractions of the day. Our guide was very informative and spoke English well. After seeing the Baby Taj, we went to the Taj Mahal. We were able to skip alot of the lines because our guide already had tickets. Entering through the west gate, they checked our bags. This is a must do part because they won't let you in if they haven't checked your bag. Our guide showed us where to get our free water bottle and shoe covers then proceeded with the tour. He was very attentive and made sure we understood what we were seeing and lent a hand in taking pictures when he thought it was the right time and spot. He has a good eye for the right shots. Shoe covering on at the base of the stairs to the Taj, we climbed up and went inside. Please respect the site and follow the rules about cameras and videos in the tomb because not doing so is only giving foreigners a bad reputation. Taking pictures outside of the tomb is very difficult, not because of the crowds, but because of the perfect symmetry of the site. Take your time and line up the shot so you don't have a leaning Taj. After the Taj, we went to the Agra Fort. This site is also included in the ticket purchased earlier. The size of the fort is staggering and brings on a sadness once understood it was also house arrest for one of the country's shahs. Once done with the fort, we went to have lunch. This was included in the price of the tour. The lunch was very good. We could eat like locals or with utensils. When we were done, we started our drive back. Our driver was nice enough to head to a local spot to shop which did not have very many foreigners. This was not a problem because we got great deals and were not hassled like at the touristy places. I would definitely recommend booking with viator and asking for Sushil as your driver and Pramod as your guide for an English speaking tour."
30,Tajmahal,There are no words to describe...,"Visiting the Taj Mahal is an experience that's difficult to put into words. Even photos don't do it justice. My first view of the Taj was from the (Mehtab Bagh) Moonlight Garden, across the Yamuna river. It seems tohave risen from its clouded heaven in all it's majesty.  The next morning, we had the incredible experience of visiting the Taj Mahal at sunrise. Despite the crowds, it was an amazing experience that moved me. Although it was quite early, there were still crowds raising their cameras and smartphones high above their heads attempting to capture the Taj in all its glory. I walked deliberately toward the majestic Taj, soaking in the dawn, slowly taking photos from every possible angle; and even managed to get a few shots without people in them. The inlay work is spectacular, and the white marble glistens in the rising sun, making this a magical experience; and certainly one not to be missed."
30,Tajmahal,Tantalising Taj !,Iconic - at 6.30 am we arrived & still had to queue to get through security. But when we did our guide 'guided' us through the exterior gardens to the majesty of this marvellous tribute. It was packed even at such an early hour - but after getting through the initial excitement that everyone there was experiencing ( & needing to sit in 'that' iconic seat for the 'must have photo') the crowds spread out. It is beautiful - everyone should go at least once in their lives........
30,Tajmahal,BUILDING OF LOVE,Taj Mahal one of amazing monuments in india. Its building of love. It so beautiful. White Marble whole building buit in 15 th century. i will salute the builder who build this wonder in 15th century. It is pride of india
30,Tajmahal,Fantastic Taj!!,"Went at 7:15 am on 18th April 2016. It was world heritage day, so no tickets!! (although the price of the tickets is Rs. 40 a piece, but still, getting a free ride feels good!). The guide - Mr. Amit Kumar, was very patient and knowledgeable and we spent a pleasant 2 hours with him. It became quite crowded and hot by the time we finished."
30,Tajmahal,Beautiful love for this temple,"Actually, I didn't go there because of the beauty, but the love story of the King who made this temple for his died queen. That the main reason made this temple became the most beautiful on the world with white stone, top of professional sculpts. you should get here the the early morning to take the sunruse picture. In the afternoon, you can go to other side of the river, in the garden opesite with this temple to take the sunset photos. You will never forget the beautiful moment for this temple."
30,Tajmahal,Breathtaking!!!,"Never imagined that I could visit the Taj Mahal. After you pass the huge wood doors and you see the Taj Mahal, it is a moving experience. I can not explain what this monument to eternal love does to you. The architecture, details, symmetry is amazing. Never been so moved by a landmark!!"
30,Tajmahal,The Best,"The Taj Mahal is in the 7 wonders of the world & now i know why, simply great & pride of India. Wonderful experience"
30,Tajmahal,good place,"Visiting the Taj Mahal was one of the highlights from my trip to India!! We arrived very early morning to beat the ""rush"", and it was a little hazy, but beautiful none the less and we returned the next morning at sunrise which was at 6 AM."
30,Tajmahal,Must visit place,It was a great experience to saw this amazing building with impressive architecture. We visited Taj Mahal for sunrise and sunset view which was beautiful.
30,Tajmahal,Marvellous....,"Just one word ""MARVELLOUS""for this piece of architecture created in 1600 century. You would get mesmerised by the entire view of this piece and rightfully the owner of one of the 7 wonders of the world. Visit at least once in life."
30,Tajmahal,Wow,A temple dedicated to love of course is a must see. This is a breath taking monument not to be missed. The stone work is brilliant as is the location
30,Tajmahal,One the 7 wonder in world,"Taj mahl holding a place for one of the 7 wonders in the world, which is really true, the monument was amazing and huge, well maintained but he people around it was not good specially guides and local people be care full when ever you are travelling aroung"
30,Tajmahal,Worlds No. 1 place,Taj Mahal is the one of the most beautiful place of the world. Epitome of Love. Person traveling to India must visit Taj Mahal.
30,Tajmahal,Made my India trip worthwhile,"Taj mahal made my India trip worthwhile. The Palace was amazing . the architectual details were unbelievable . I would recommend going with a guide, you get in faster. there were long lines when we went - having a guide, we were able to by pass the long lines especially it was very hot. Knowing the history of the Taj mahal before you go will make you appreciate it more"
30,Tajmahal,Worth taking the trip!,"Visiting the Taj Mahal was one of the highlights from my trip to India!! We arrived very early morning to beat the ""rush"", and it was a little hazy, but beautiful none the less. The history makes it even more magical! A must see if you are traveling to India!"
30,Tajmahal,A sight for sore eyes,"It was just spectacular to visit the Taj Mahal. It was very hot, 44 degrees C, and even with the heat, it was magnificent. We went mid day, and we returned the next morning at sunrise which was at 6 AM"
30,Tajmahal,Majestic!,"It has been on my bucket list for years, it didn't disappoint. What an amazing place! We were quite unlucky in that 3 out of 4 minarets had scaffolding on them when we visited. The detail on the Taj Mahal itself is very nice."
30,Tajmahal,Everything I expected - wonderful,At the moment it has scaffolding up the side structures (3 of them) which rather spoils the photographs but a magnificent building despite this. We visited the Taj Mahal for sunrise and went across the river and approached it from the back at sunset for some more unusual photographs.
30,Tajmahal,memorable,Visited hassle free with all family members on a day when Price Williams and Kate visited. Never had any trouble.
30,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal - 7 Wonders,Went there long time back around 2009 via my own transport. It is worth going for once in lifetime moment and cherishing the ancient history. Other forts are also there
30,Tajmahal,Picture postcard perfect,We got up early in the morning to ensure we missed the rush and although we arrived 30 minutes before opening we were not the first. Making the early start was worth while as crowds were minimum and watching the sun rise on the building was worth the early start. It is a most impressive sight and a must if visiting India.
30,Tajmahal,Amazing thing on earth,"its one of the amazing building on earth , the view and height is magnificent , if you in India you must visit this place"
30,Tajmahal,Wah Taj!,"Me & my friend plan to visit Taj Mahal in Agra. We book newest train called 'Gatumaan Express' which takes almost 100 minutes to reach Agra from Delhi. In the train they serve food & beverages free of cost. It's AC sitting chairs. Reached Taj mahal in afternoon is was little hot. We were offerred to take tourist guide at cost. We took a photographer, he took our almost 40 amazing pictures. You must bring your water bottle with you and bring some changes ( indian rupees coin) if you wish to go to toilet they charge for using washroom. Overall it was a wish come true trip.... as i always wanted to wish this seven wonder of the world."
30,Tajmahal,Not disappointed,"The Taj Mahal does not disappoint. We arrived at sunrise, and had high expectations of the effects of the light. In fact the real impact happens an hour later when the marble begins to glitter. The serenity of the gardens is in stark contrast to the city of Agra, though there were fewer hawkers than we expected at that early hour."
30,Tajmahal,"""Taj Mahal""- Serene ,Beautiful, Must Visit","I visited this place in 2015, it was amazing lifetime experience to visit Taj Mahal and see the beautiful Mahal built Shahjahan. This amazing piece of architecture built by Mugal emperor. Its a must visit place with your the loved ones."
30,Tajmahal,Took my breath away,"My group arrived around 730am which was the best time because the weather was great and less crowds. The taj up close was so intricate and stunning, totally worth traveling around the world for. Heads up, you're not allowed to bring in any gum, food, cosmetics...or even clip on ring light for your phone, I almost had mine taken away. You go through a security pat down, metal detector and bag search. Also you'll need to remove your shoes or wear shoe covers once you walk in the mausoleum. The grounds are beautiful, but the walk to the gate is a bit chaotic as street vendors are very aggressive."
30,Tajmahal,A must-see,"Sunrise is the best time to visit, not too hot. Such a beautiful place, although you don't need to spend too long in Agra. There isn't much else to see. We didn't use a guide, we just did some reading beforehand. Expect crowds!"
30,Tajmahal,Beautiful,"Very beautiful, beware it can get pretty crowed, avoid visiting in april if possible as it is very hot"
30,Tajmahal,Amazing Architecture,"Undoubtedly the best iconic structure of india. White marble paradise standing next to curvy Yamuna is a treat to watch. There are many interesting stories, facts as regards to its constuction and design. One should definitely hire a good guide to understand what it took to build this gigantic structure, otherwise it looks just a brick/mortar. It takes minimum 2 hrs to move around and enjoy/appreciate its beauty. Visited after 11 years, lots of changes as regards to its securiy, cleaniness. Really enjoyed the visit."
30,Tajmahal,A must!,"Everyone should see the Taj in their lifetime. It is an outstanding site with so much to learn about history, architecture and life."
30,Tajmahal,Good,Must watch but in winters .never try to go to Agra in summers and check all details before.a little knowledge and study can make your experience better. And don't expect too much from any place.
30,Tajmahal,Even better close up,"Getting up at 4.30 to be at the Taj for 5.45 was well worth it. The Taj Mahal is iconic but does not disappoint and the grounds are fabulous to walk around. From a distance it appears to be all white,but when you go close up it has the most amazing intricate marble inlay. So peaceful even with large crowds."
30,Tajmahal,Hot and humid climate,Try to go early morning during April to avoid hot weather and crowd. Parking charge 80 rs Eco bus from parking till entry gate (1.5km) Eastern gate cost 5rs person. I recommend shoe covers cost 10rs pair Best time to enter around 6-6:30am sunrise view and will find easy photo shoot area. Try not to bring any bags or food items inside. Entry fees domestic Indian 40rs.
30,Tajmahal,Amazing Agra,Much smaller than I imagined but breathtakingly beautiful . Intricated detail in amazing condition even with its millions of tourists absolutely worth a visit
30,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,"Absolutely amazing, we went early morning as the sun was rise. The reflection of the Taj on the water was brill. We were very lucky as we had an amazing tour guide. Sorry can't remember his name. It was a shame they were cleaning 3 of the columns, hence they had scaffolding around them."
30,Tajmahal,Bucket List Item,"Like most travelers, the Taj Mahal was a bucket list item. I am happy to report that it did not disappoint. I would recommend arriving early in the morning (pre-dawn) to get the best pictures and hopefully avoid the long lines."
30,Tajmahal,Go in the morning,"Wake up early and watch the sunrise here. You'll beat the crowds, the heat and you'll hear people singing and monkeys screeching. The camel guys actually seem pretty nice in the morning and one even let me ride his camel for free. Towards the middle of the day it becomes more of a crazy tourist attraction and in my opinion it ruins the magical feeling of the place. Stay close and wake up early, it's worth it."
30,Tajmahal,A Masterpiece work,This place is absolutely mesmerizing. You are amazed at the intricate work done on the walls.It takes 2 hours to complete the tour of it. An official guide will be of great help and they are very polite and tell you about the history of this place.Entrance fees are cheap and the layout is well organised. Security is tight and at times in peak season there is a very long que to get inside.
30,Tajmahal,unique,"it was all like that we have heard about it is one of famous monument of Uttar pradesh tourism, taj mahal is very beautiful and Amazing place for tourist"
30,Tajmahal,Must visit,I'm sure I dont think I can add anything on this review as you all know this is best thing you can see in india and probably one of the in the whole world.
30,Tajmahal,Tear Drop of India is a must See!,"Such an amazing building iconic of India with such an endearing tale. Also with a darker side that most don't know about! Worth the time and money to pay for an expedited pass to the front, Will save hours! Also worth the $$ to get a guide in advance."
30,Tajmahal,As beautiful as you'd expect it to be,What more can be said of the Taj Mahal? It is breathtaking and the details are beautiful. Definitely a must see!
30,Tajmahal,Taj magic,"So we went today around 3.30pm. We were told you should go for sunrise and not on a Thursday (as it is shut on Fridays) and so very busy. However Thursday was the only day we had and we were in Jaipur for sunrise. I have to say it was no way as busy as we had been led to believe it would be. In fact I think our timing was perfect, just after the heat of the day and just before everyone arrived for sunset. It is 1000 rupies for foreigners. With that you get some shoe covers for inside the taj and a bottle of water. You get fast tracked through the queue (fair enough after paying so much). We did not get a guide nor did we suffer from much hassle. Had we wanted one we would have probably got the audio guide. We were worried as may places it says you can't take mobile phones in and we do not have another camera however this was not true and everyone was using mobiles (even inside the taj building which we really shouldn't do). We got some great photos by being polite and waiting our turn and not paying anyone. We were dropped within easy walking distance and our tuk tuk driver waited for us. All in all it was very painless and I hope this review will help make it painless nor others too."
30,Tajmahal,Wah Taj Wah !!,"Amazing structure , perfect architecture & worth visit. You can't miss it if you are near to Agra. Try to book hotel near to Taj Mahal, it will save your time."
30,Tajmahal,An exceptional engineering feat,A must-visit if time allows. Easier if a guide is hired and better still if the guide is well informed. Visit the outer perimeters inside the grounds too.
30,Tajmahal,Amazing world wonder,Taj Mahal in a picture a stunning beauty but the story behind the taj mahal made it as a world wonder.
30,Tajmahal,you can get energy of it,very nice architecture with nice calligraphy it is picturesque and you can stand in front of it to get photo.
30,Tajmahal,#love_india,Wow incridable place with fantastic art stone .every thing there is amazing & the view . To ho dont come to vist taj mahal try as hard as you can and vist the place you will not be dipointed
30,Tajmahal,"Beautiful, as expected, but a shame about the scaffolding!","We were there in April 2016 and three of the towers were in scaffolding. A real shame, but necessary, I guess! The main photo points are 'commandered' by Indian photo journalists, so the tourists never get a chance for the fab location photos! There are so many people there that it is almost crazy. Guess that's what happens when a place is so popular..."
50,Tajmahal,Stunning,"The Taj Mahal is every bit as beautiful and impressive as you imagine it to be. My friends and I had a personal guide who fast tracked us through the process of getting into the site. Our main visit was in the morning when the sun was beating down on the building, making it look creamy white. However, our guide also took us to a park on the backside of the Taj Mahal and on the other side of the river. That visit was at sunset and produced a pinkish tinge to the Taj. This is definitely a 'must see' if ever you visit Agra"
50,Tajmahal,Magnificant,"We had to go through a screening process having our bags etc checked, however this was very quick and the staff were very efficient. I can't tell you how fantastic and awe inspiring the Taj Mahal is, it is just magnificant. We were given some coverings to go over our shoes for when we entered the building, which is only right. There are great photo opportunities and the view overlooking the river at the back of the building is just fantastic. There are also professional photographers that will take any photos you like, these are well worth the money, we bought 10 photos of wonderful quality for 1000 rupees which is about £9.00. Please make sure you visit this amazing structure. The workmanship and beauty is indescribable. To top an amazing time our daughter got engaged there, a perfect end to a perfect visit. When you leave there are a lot of people wanting you to visit their shops, be polite and just walk away (if you want to) everyone is nice."
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj. Period.,"Monument symbolising love, architecture, history and photo-ops in modern times. To our guests from foreign nations, it is a visit worth making if you happen to be in India. Do take a guide to get into history and not just the physical excellence of this wonder of the world."
50,Tajmahal,Words can't describe it,"Seriously, words can't describe it, the echo on the inside is something out of this world, not a normal echo, it's astonishingly big and full of optical illusions and inlaid precious stones, just amazing. Photos don't do it justice."
50,Tajmahal,Stunning,I have heard many things about the Taj Mahal but until you see it with your own eyes it it just not the same. It is a spectacular work of art. It is very busy and with India being so hot it is a little uncomfortable however it is a MUST!
50,Tajmahal,Amazing,It is a very beautiful place..........it is also known in seven wonders of the world.... One of the best place to visit in agra ...
50,Tajmahal,Divine,If you are in Agra and you have not seen Taj Mahal- it can be only a curse. To make the most out of Agra- this is a must go monument. Make sure to go early mornings to make it worth watching the monument.
50,Tajmahal,"Yes, go see it!","Taj Mahal is one of those places you've seen so many pictures of, you wonder if it's worth the visit. It is. Absolutely one of the most beautiful pieces of art in the world, and much greater close up than in photos."
50,Tajmahal,Wonderful!,The arcetecture and the story is wonderful! I especially liked when we got to see the fire stones! Really amazing to see them glow like that! The surroundings are also very beautiful.
50,Tajmahal,very impressive,"was really very impressive to see the taj in real life, definitely exceeds expectations. lots of people and very crowded. apparently is best to go at sunset or sunrise."
50,Tajmahal,Just amazing...,"No need to say anything... Just amazing... Don't be drawn into getting a tour guide, you can walk through yourself at your own pace, enjoy what you want... Be prepared for it to be busy on Saturdays and Sunday's, don't carry a tripod... They aren't allowed!"
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal history and myths..,"Our itinerary had specified a sunset visit to the Taj Mahal but when we arrived in Agra our guide, Saurav, suggested going there straight away as the light would be nicer in the morning and the crowds a little less - especially since it was a Sunday and a popular day for Indians to visit. We took up his proposal so were there by about 9.00, but already it was very busy. But crowds or no crowds, it is still an amazing sight and one not to be missed. And besides, in the extensive gardens there are places you can escape the mass of people and enjoy the bird song while reflecting on this magical place.  There is possibly no more famous building in the world, so before you visit you will have seen very many photos and think you know what to expect. I was prepared to be disappointed, just in case it didn’t live up to those expectations (I almost wrote, “in case it didn’t live up to the hype” but that’s perhaps a bit harsh). I even half-expected not to be impressed, but of course I was. There’s a reason why the Taj Mahal is so acclaimed after all – it is truly beautiful. And there is a beautiful, if sad, story behind it.  The Mughal emperor Shah Jahan, grandson of Akbar who had built the great fort here in Agra, was a lover of great art and architecture, responsible for some of the Mughal Empire’s most lovely and enduring buildings. As was usual at that time, he had a number of wives, but his favourite among them was Mumtaz Mahal whom he had married more for love than political expedience. He was grief-stricken when she died in childbirth in 1631, giving birth to their 14th child (as our guide told the story, he also felt guilty that he had expected too much of her in that respect). After a period of mourning in which he shut himself away from the world, he emerged inspired to build a tomb for her that would be a paradise on earth. The Taj Mahal is the result.  But the emperor was not left to mourn his beloved here. Soon after its completion, in 1658, he fell ill. His son Dara Shikoh took on the role of regent but was challenged and overthrown by another son, Aurangzeb. The latter declared Shah Jahan unfit to rule (according to our guide, basing this on his extravagance in spending so much on wonderful new buildings and patronising the arts) and had him put under house arrest at nearby Agra Fort. There he was forced to live out his remaining years in a few small rooms, from which he could see, but never visit, the tomb of his beloved Mumtaz Mahal.  Next tip: practical information for a visit to the Taj Mahal."
50,Tajmahal,Wow,We visited India primarily just to see the Taj Mahal. It did not disappoint.  We were accompanied by our guide who was really knowledgable and this assisted greatly. It is hard to believe that with the poverty and chaos around the at am that such a special place can exist.
50,Tajmahal,Truly a symbol of Love & Beauty,"Having been born and brought up in Agra, I visited Taj countless times. I can describe Taj in every possible way because of its Beauty and Greatness.  Thousands of visitors come to visit Taj daily and its one of the most happening places in Agra and India.  It can be visited with Family / Friends but don't forget keep your camera with you.  Best locations for a Photograph : 1. On Bench in front of the Taj Mahal 2. Picking the ""Chotti of Taj Mahal"" :)  I would recommend a visiting it in Moonlight as well."
50,Tajmahal,checking out the Taj,"The palace is well kept, staff seemed fine. Beautiful views all around and the architecture was amazing. Would recommend"
50,Tajmahal,"Magic, magic, magic","After dreaming of visiting this icon for many years I actually made it!! My husband and I were on an organised tour. We got there early, there's several security steps to go through, bag searches and metal detectors. I understand that food is not allowed but water is ok. As you enter through the impressive entrance gate the magical Taj Mahal is framed through an archway in front of you. The early morning light reflects off the building illuminating it - a real wow moment. The Taj Mahal was built by the grieving Murghal emperor Shah Jahan for his favourite wife who died in childbirth - her 14th child. The gardens are beautiful with a lotus pool which looks glorious. Professional photographers are keen to catch you to take those special snaps - and they were very good too. There's a route everyone has to follow to enter the tomb, and you need to wear shoe covers in order to enter. It's quite spartan inside though there are fantastic decorative panels and calligraphy. When we were there 3 of the minarets were covered in scaffolding which was a bit disappointing in the photos. There were quite a few monkeys playing in the gardens as we walked around - I rather liked that. Really wonderful, something to cross off my bucket list."
50,Tajmahal,Wow,"I visited The Taj in March and it is as stunning in real life as what it is in pictures. I was concerned due to the scaffolding, however I shouldn't of worried as it did not take away any of the beauty. We went at sunrise, which I advised as, even though there were a lot of people, it was still pretty peaceful and we managed to get a few pictures without people in them. We paid approx £8 to get in-we did not take a guide or photographer. We stayed for 4 hours-in that time, we found a quiet spot at one of the gates to the side of Taj and took some time to reflect and take in the beauty-India is such a hectic place, it was nice to sit in a peaceful environment (if we had a guide, I do not think we would of had an opportunity to do this, guides in general rush you round as they want to move onto the next person). By the time we left, the main gate was really busy, you could hardly move, so I really do strongly advise to go early. You cannot come to India without visiting The Taj Mahal. It's a must do for everybody."
50,Tajmahal,Simply amazing,"We were on a golden triangle tour. What an amazing place. We were the first people into the Taj Mahal. We were queuing at 5-45am. What a beautiful sight to see the sun rise behind the temple. This was for me the highlight of the tour. Such a peaceful place. Loving memories came to mind. Worth going early as it gets very busy. Sat on the Diana seat. Would love to go back, but the impact would not be nearly as good."
50,Tajmahal,Doesn't need an explanation,Was my second trip. The last one was 15 years ago. Really really beautiful. Lives up to all the hype.
50,Tajmahal,Just stunning,Our second visit and it was just as impressive. The early morning is quiet compared to later in the day and a much more pleasant temperature.
50,Tajmahal,World of wonder,"Nice place to visit once in a life time.Maza agaya ,symbol of love.monument mai aur hota kya hai.lol"
50,Tajmahal,Wahhhh taj,Taj is taj nothing can compare this it's lovely and beautiful made by King nice must visit this once in life
50,Tajmahal,Absolutely amazing place,Wonderful.....dont have words to describe this......its one of the things in India I am most proud of.....must visit for every indian at least once in life
50,Tajmahal,Incredible,"It truly is an incredible sight and a must see if touring the north of India. I recommend the sunrise tour as it is cooler and less busy but you will need to get up early as there was a queue at 5.45am. If your budget allows stay at the Oberoi as it is 2 minutes in a buggy. We had a guide called Ali , via Cox and Kings and he was brilliant."
50,Tajmahal,One for the Bucket List,"Visiting the Taj has to be on everyone's lifetime lists, being such an important cultural and historical icon. The monument lives up to its reputation and will transport you to a different time."
50,Tajmahal,The one and only majestic taj!,"A trip to India is not complete without a visit to the majestic Taj Mahal! I suggest that you but the tickets online in advance and arrive very early (at least 5am) if you want to beat the queues! The sunrise is definitely a great time to visit because of the light but if you don't want to be caught out in the morning confusion, later in the day is fine too. The architecture is impressive at any time! Great vibes too, it is worth sitting in the gardens enjoying the serenity of the place (if you can block out the noise and the crowd!). A shame that it is so busy and people push each other to get a photo spot but this is true of other famous places too. One rather annoying logistic matter, is that they split the entry queue by sex and then give priority to men who are allowed in first while women have to wait in the line. Equality aside, this is extremely unpractical because people are split up and end up having to wait for each other!"
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj!,"We saw the Taj from the other side of Yamuna! We went in early that morning in December, and there was a private viewing experience of the Taj from the Mehtab Bagh. Wah Taj! is an understatement and it was an amazing viewing experience on that December morning around 6.30 am! No words to describe, got to experience it."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing place which has to be seen,Our (pre-booked) guide helped to explain a lot about the Taj Mahal which definitely made it come to life. We saw it on a hazy sunset which was lovely but probably best at sunrise from what we were told. The symmetry is amazing! Closed on Fridays though.
50,Tajmahal,Awesome,"Superb Architecture, the most beautyful place in Agra, its a Taj of Agra Words can't describe it, a wonderful place not to be missed."
50,Tajmahal,The Taj Mahal,A wonder of the world. My guide also took me to the back side of the Taj Mahal for another view. Amazing. What more needs to be said?
50,Tajmahal,Excellent Historic Place,Taj is an excellent historic place. Probably words can't describe it.It is wonderful place and brilliant architecture!  Try to visit during sunrise or full moon night!
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj!!!,"Took kids to see Taj Mahal. and they were just mesmerized by it Beauty and Grander. Seriously, its Wah Taj!!!"
50,Tajmahal,Historical place,Visited with my foreign colleagues. We were amazed to see such a huge standing symbol of love with so much of intricate and delicate works in and around Taj Mahal. A must visit place in India. Ask for the guide from India Travel Choice agent with name Mohammad Ali. He is a wonderful guide.
50,Tajmahal,beatiful,"super awesome architecture. it is so beautiful and fresh to see the water near the main building. but inside taj, you cannot take photo. you also have to wear shoe cover. keep the place clean."
50,Tajmahal,Taj the great,"If one want to explore the power of mathematical symmetry, then I advice you to go and see Taj Mahal, but probably you need and expert guide who would be able to explain the nuts and bolts of the Taj Mahal and its power of octagonal shape. We found a guide who was highly qualified and explained to us in a very short period of time every building and structure inside Taj. Remember some areas photography is not permitted, but some areas you can take photo. Taj Mahal is gradually becoming yellowish colour because of environmental pollution. I have noticed that they are using clay to remove pollution from the surface of the marvel stone."
50,Tajmahal,Wonderful,"Words can't describe it, a wonderful place not to be missed. We were advised to visit at sunrise the early wake up was certainly worth it."
50,Tajmahal,"Wow, as amazing as it looks in photos.","A fantastic sight, better than you expect from photos. It was very busy when we visited, I had to push my way in as both women's queues went through one metal detector, so not for the overly polite. But once n the detail on the building is amazing, it was great siting quietly watching the colours change as the sun went down."
40,Tajmahal,A spectacle of love,This place is a gem in the middle of a rough country. The dedication and preservation of the taj is amazing yet only if they could do this for their people and the nation as a whole.  I had booked a tour guide for the entire day which arranged a train from Delhi and around Agra. Was great.  The Taj itself is a massive complex with a great history of culture and love. Try to avoid the weekends and the high season. April isn't too bad and be lucky enough to visit on a full moon as they stay open late for the glow. Also note Friday it is closed.  You can book a guide or use the audio guide. Be careful of panhandlers outside and the 3wheelers who will annoy you to death. Just stay committed if your not needing anything from them.  Overall a must see.
40,Tajmahal,"Don't go on the weekend, too busy.","If you go here be sure to book a guide! Without a guide you will be stuck in huge queues. Once inside it is stunning, be sure not to take tripods as they are not allowed and you will be guided back out, nearly happened to me but my guide saved me. Was disappointed with the scaffolding on the pillars."
40,Tajmahal,What an art,The Taj Mahal must be seen in person to get the total perspective of its beauty . Must visit for everyone. Its closed on Friday. Entrance fee is 1000 INR for foreign national and INR 40 for Indians . TAJ is the epitome of tremendous architecture .
40,Tajmahal,Nice but overrated,"Well I guess it is THE Taj Mahal. Somewhat of a must go if you are in the vicinity. Wouldn't deny the architecture is beautiful but it is so tourist. Full of touts and what no outside. As you would expect in India, there is a special tourist price for entrance fee which is way way higher than what the locals pay. I guess it is still worth it to pay for a once in a lifetime visit."
40,Tajmahal,AMAZING N AWESOME,".Although it is being cleaned , but to visit it is really exiting. We traveled from Delhi with Gatiman express to Agra, and opted full day visit of Agra with irctc. The guide Farhan is very knowledgeable and shared good information with us which made the visit really worth. He explained about taj in detail which made us thrill. The Taj is real beautiful and the history or engineering is excellent. We had good time there as visited in morning hours and in summer so very little rush."
40,Tajmahal,Place Of Huge Revenue Making Center,"Parking was very expensive, ricksaw puller was also very expensive. Guides were with poor knowledge. Only making money in short period."
40,Tajmahal,Such a beautiful building,"The Taj is such a beautiful building, well made, the attention to detail is amazing, and its beautiful and white, (amazing for India seeing as the rest of the place is polluted and filthy). We woke up early on Saturday morning, it was the 1st of April and they'd just put the price up to 1000R (£10) instead of £7.50. we set off at 5.30am, we'd arranged for a tuk tuk man to take us to the taj in the morning but he didn't turn up. we later found out tuk tuks can't take you anyway as vehicles aren't allowed near the taj to try and combat pollution. we found a bicycle man who said he'd take us, so we hopped on. it was quicker if we'd have walked! (we later found out this was a scam as the ticket office offers a free bus to the Taj but we didn't know.) we finally got to the ticket office, theres a seperate queue for men and women, (the men try to push in but be firm!) the staff seemed to be in no rush as Indians do everything in their own time. there was a hold up as one of the staff woudn't accept one womans money as they said it was a fake note and she couldn't pay any other way. I was conscious of time (we were trying to get sunrise photos) so I lent her the money so she could hurry up and get her ticket. meanwhile I got stuck with the fake note! watch out for those. there was a guide offering his services for 1575R (£15), I wanted a guide, was tired and agreed. at the office you get free water and shoe covers. Back onto the bicycle and off we went. When you arive at the east gate, theres a massive queue, (unavoidable) again seperate for men and women. there are staff at the front that check your ticket, then you go through an xray machine like they have at the airport. and you get patted down by security. your bags also go through a machine, by this time we'd already missed the sunrise photos, it'd taken an hour to get here and to get in. so my photographer friend ran off trying to get the perfect photo. we managed to get some good ones, you just have to be patient as there are always lots of people milling around and all trying to get the same photo at the same time. we acquired a photographer who took some photos of us both quickly, and said can get them developed if we'd like?(on the Diana chair etc) we agreed as we said we wont be coming back so off he went, and we were left with the guide who showed us around the outside, told us abit of info, and showed us around the inside. the building is huge and beautifully made, from the smallest detail to the shimmering marble, the moonlight tour would've been impressive. the guide wasn't that good to be honest, and spent most of the time walking around in silence and me asking questions, we walked past other guides who were much more chatty and informative. not worth £15. you have to wear shoe covers when you go into the actual building, and you can't take photos inside. it was a shame as the pools in the garden hardly had water in as they were being renovated and the minarets, 3 of them, had bamboo scaffolding around them as they were being cleaned. eventually we made our way around and were ready to leave. we had to wait until our photographer man came back and were presented with our album. the photos weren't that good as either us, or the taj was in focus, not both. and paid about £24 for it. not worth it either. As we made our way outside there are lots of hawkers who try to get you to look in their shop, theres lots of things on sale, postcards, posters, sandstone elephants etc. our bicycle man had waited for us and took us back to our hotel. at first he'd said 100R to take us there and back, as soon as we got off he raised it to 200R, typical, this happens alot. we said no gave him 100R and walked off. (we would've walked if we'd known how close it was but there are no signs anywhere). all in all the building is beautiful, but the constant scamming got the better of me that day and left feeling cheated and overpriced for everything. shame."
40,Tajmahal,Impressive,We walked through the park in the evening which is across the river at the back of the Taj Mahal so were able to enjoy that view during sunset. The next day we went early in the morning to get into the entrance line. Sunrise is one of the best times to take pictures of the Taj Mahal so go early!
40,Tajmahal,Great wonder,"Visiting this ancient monument will make ur soul happy n satisfied, specially if travelling with ur wife ..... its a real wonder of the world...must see"
40,Tajmahal,It was a shame it was being cleaned!,"Still lovely though, a must visit at some point (just make sure you don't go when its being cleaned!)"
40,Tajmahal,Look out for heat,"In summers preferably go early morning about 0630 or so. They open at 0610.  Morning is good for avoiding heat specially for oldies and children.  Photographs come out best in morning light. Dont forget to take a local guide if not for their little knowing story just for taking your photos.  Try taj reflection in water, in your sunglasses, also through the carved grills of marble and from mehtab bagh if you are Carrying a good zoom lens."
40,Tajmahal,Beauty of Taj,As we all know Taj Mahal is on of the & wonders of the world. Taj mahal is properly maintained and cleaned.
40,Tajmahal,In my imagination,"In my imagination the Taj Mahal was set in a jungle. Listening to locals, it seems it was in the past.  Taj Mahal is still one of the must sees in India, like the Eiffel tower in France or Uluru in Australia.  The visiting hours seem a little out of tune with dusk and dawn (even in the garden on the other river bank).  Hire a guide for 200 rupees (no more) and he will show you around and tell you where to find the best shots (there are more).  Unfortunately it seems some of the towers will always be in cleaning, thus with structures around them."
40,Tajmahal,"Under maintenance, but must see","As it is the beginning of the season the minarets were under maintenance, but anyway you cannot come to Agra and miss the Taj Mahal. Crowded by locals (only a few foreigners there at the moment). Keep a bottle of water with you as there is nothing to sell inside."
40,Tajmahal,beautifull,Its even more beautifull than in the picture. I'm in India right now (april) and low season has begon. Therefore not so crowded. When entering dont' buy anything (including photos from seller wWho Will take pictures for You at the taj mahal). Walk around and enjoy. Its defenetly wort your while.
40,Tajmahal,Interesting,"We went at dawn and there were so many tourists (and Indians). Did not take any pictures because there was scaffolding for reparation/renovation of the minarets. The Shah Jahan story was worth learning, even if embellished. The Taj is not made of solid marble; it is faced in marble"
40,Tajmahal,A little disappointing,"My wife and I visited the Taj Mahal in March and althought the building itself is very impressive, we were a little disappointed to find 3 of the minarets were covered in scaffolding and under renovation. The detail of the construction is amazing and the fact that it was all transported there by elephants from quite a distance. Still a must see if in India."
40,Tajmahal,"Heaven in the middle of Garbage , Best time: sunrise, Best route: western gate","Next time if I go to visit this beautiful place, I will not stay more than 2hours in Agra and I will go directly to the western gate just to see this fantastic Mahal. We traveled there in April, few months before our travel I read a report which they collect 2 tons of garbage out of Agra because Mr.Obama was going there for a visit (his visit was cancelled at the end) and we was hope to see the beautiful clean place. As usual we took an evening walk in the old parts of the city on the evening. the south gate and the west gate was closed. we felt the terrible smell all around the old parts and the park on the west side of Taj Mahal was furnished by garbage. I couldn't believe why this city which have the top destination for tourists who visit India is look like this !!! On the day after before the sunrise we go to the eastern gate. nice street with few very expensive hotels. they charge 1000 RP and they will give you a water bottle. you cannot take anything else inside. When we entered it was like you see a castle in the middle of heaven. very clean and of course beautiful. but I am wondering where does all of this money goes!"
40,Tajmahal,"Very Good hotel with all what you need for a family leisure trip - Pool, Gaming Mall for kids and adults, Amazing food..","Very Good hotel with all what you need for a family leisure trip - Pool, Gaming Mall for kids and adults, Amazing food"
40,Tajmahal,One day trip from Gurgaon to see the Taj Mahal with the family!,"I am an Indian born living in the US from past 9-10 years. Going back is always easier for people like me since we are very familiar to the people, language (depending upon where you are), etc. We stayed at Marriott in Gurgaon. The staff was very helpful and always had a smile on their face. We are family of 4 plus my cousin accompanied us. We decided to do a one day trip to see the famous Taj Mahal. We rented a car with a driver (Toyota Innova) from one of the famous websites. The car came to the hotel around 8 am. We left from the hotel and decided to go to Mathura first (birthplace of Lord Krishna). It was nothing special. We got to Taj Mahal around 2pm. There is a huge parking lot so after our driver dropped us off at the entrance, he went parked his car while we started walking towards the Taj Mahal. Mind you - you can either walk or take an E-rickshaw (green/energy efficient). There will be people asking you to get in. If you want to walk, just walk. We were 5 so we heckled the price and got them down to 100 rupees for 5 of us. It is literally a 5-6 minutes walk tho.When we reached to the ticket window, I was surprised to see the price difference of entry fee between Indian and non-Indian residents. It's almost 500% more for Non-Indian residents which is ridiculous. The lines are insane and people push and shove each other a lot so you have to be patient. When we got into the gate, I was SURPRISED by the this magnificent architectural gem. It is really something special. Especially the marble carvings which are so intricate and detailed - mind blown. There was a very long line to get in to see the tomb. People cut lines all the time; we got really annoyed twice when a family tried to cut us over and over again. The cops are there but they are useless and I heard them making fun of a family of Asian ethnicity but unfortunately I had to keep moving. It is better to keep moving than to get into an argument especially in this part of India where people are straight up rude. Anyway, after the longest wait, we went in saw NOTHING inside and came out the other door. The cops were pushing people so again - not the best experience. I would suggest people to go on off peak days and times. We went after a holiday so it was insanely crowded. When we were done taking pictures we started walking out. There are a lot of street hawkers and kids who will follow you to purchase things from them and if you don't say anything, they will keep following you. However, be polite and brush them away. We walked towards the parking lot and found our car. We asked our driver to stop somewhere for food on our way back to the hotel. After a couple of hours, he stopped at this amazing DHABA (street side restaurant) which was pure veg. We had the best north indian food EVER.....everything was amazing. Too bad I don't remember the name. We also found out we had to pay for the driver's food. We reached hotel around 1130pm. The price of the taxi was pre-fixed (around INR 6500). The driver tried to charge us INR 7500 so we called the website customer support and had him talk to them. They looked at our transaction and told him it would be no more than INR 6500 as specified. He got a little amped up about it but it was all good in the end. I was very happy with the customer support (it wasn't OLA) they provided. Over all, it was a fun day. Taj Mahal is definitely something you should check it out once in a life time. It didn't make it to the 7 wonders of the world for nothing! :) Hope this helps!"
40,Tajmahal,Nice and big on the outside.,"Not terribly impressive on the inside. Two dimly lit replicas of graves. Got some good pictures and had fun, worth the 1000 rupees, though it could cost much much less. Oh and don't go with a tour-guide named Kasser-Sa'id. We didn't, but he leached onto us anyway."
40,Tajmahal,Wonderful to see the Taj in the morning,"Seeing the Taj Mahal in person is a great experience from previously seeing it only in pictures. Make sure you go early in the day to avoid the very large crowds. Be prepared for the ""airport"" style security, and it's best not to take any bag or backpack in with you. The only thing I was disappointed with was the fact that 3 of the minarets were covered in scaffolding for cleaning. We didn't get to see an unobstructed view, but it was still nice to view this beautiful building."
40,Tajmahal,Magnificent monument of Love!,the only worth for a visit in Agra is the Taj Mahal - the teardrop on the face of eternity! The people are not that friendly and doing such business for tourists so be careful! During our visit the Taj pillars were under construction and the weather is too hot and humid.
40,Tajmahal,Magnificent building,"It's a one of the 7 wonder of the world. So it's definitely gonna to be great But the entrance ticket is 750 for foreigners now. And according to the locals, it's going to be raised to 1200rps soon The entrance ticket included a bottle of water and shoe covers too"
40,Tajmahal,An awesome place to get real Mughal Indian history details,"Taj Mahal, is best place to review Mughal Architecture in India... I like the place quite much and have been visiting to understand Mughal history and its architecture."
40,Tajmahal,Wah Taj!,A review of Taj Mahal is a very difficult one. If we look at the architecture and the vastness of the monument you have only one word - wow!. The first view will leave a lasting impression. Management inside the Taj Mahal complex is also very good. Touts are there outside the complex near the entry gates and tries to make a bit of trouble. Just avoid them and go straight to the ticket counter and buy the ticket yourself. Ask for south gate as that is least crowded. One should also not miss the museum which is inside the Taj Complex towards the left once you enter. Its an old building hosting some old photos and artifacts. The complex offers show covers which you can take from ticket counter or inside the complex on the first level of the actual monument. Overall its a must see for a person visiting Agra and is the prime reason why one should visit Agra.
40,Tajmahal,Priority for our vacation,"awesome place and knowledgeable guide was good combination. We walked around and took so many pictures. Photos from any good point, witnessed the amazing view."
40,Tajmahal,An Unneeded Review,Overview: I don't think an overview is necessary for such a renowned attraction.  Pros: One of the Seven Wonders and for great reason - it is stunning.  Cons: The amount of visitors was definitely an undesired part of our visit. We got there at approximately 0530 and the queue was already astounding.
40,Tajmahal,Taj mahal Agra India,On my visit on 5th April 2016 at Taj; I find it Marvel stone very dirty viz yellow. Pl. refer to a picture taken on 5th April 2016. And it three Meenars out of four covered with iron pipes for cleaning job. On two days latter I came to know that the Tumblr of Taj will be covered for cleaning purposes. So tourists visiting Taj are advised to take a note of this aspect. Drps.
40,Tajmahal,Nice Place,"Good Place to visit with family.When we went there is a good season ,enjoyed a lot.children also liked the most."
40,Tajmahal,"Impressive in the details, worth a visit, but HOT","The day I went was VERY hot (in April) so if you are planning to go in May, June, July, may the forces be with you because it is hot and humid during that time. I recommend getting a tour so you know what you are looking at. Also, there are some photographers there (on affiliated with the tour guide I had) that took some awesome shots and were a reasonable price. Great place to visit to watch the sunset and the Taj changes hues slightly as the sun's position changes. Basically this place is Geometry and symmetry on steriods and it was a great sight to see. I do think Sheik Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi is more impressive though."
40,Tajmahal,Memorable visit,"The visit and the view of tajmahal is awesome ,however more need to be done about the support services.its a wonder of the world ,but the parking at the western gate ,i experienced is not organised and the parking lot is hafazard.the parking staff are very arrogant,and rude is marshalling ur vehicle to the parking lot,the in and out gate for the parking lot is not marked. The staff at parking lot ,control the shuttle service of camel rides and horse rides and quote any price ,, for shuttle,there is no standard rate.and u need to haggle for a rate. The shoe covers are sold at rs 10 a pair at parking lot and as u go closer to taj ticket counter ,the same covers are sold at rs 5/- a pair ,with these experiences . The whole good feel of taj experience..... Gets diluted."
30,Tajmahal,Of course!,"Yes its stunning. Yes it amazing to get a chance to see it in person, but there is not much to it more than looking at the beautiful building. Nevertheless, of course it is a must to visit!"
30,Tajmahal,Understand to Appreciate this Wonder,A lot have been said and written about it that I don't need to add anything more. Would like to say that read about it before you see to understand the great work for example the external paintings of flowers are actually made of stones like jade.
30,Tajmahal,Needs maintenance,"Not as saw many years back, not shining white any more.. needs good level of maintenance considering number of tourist"
30,Tajmahal,An architectural marvel but not as well maintained as it should be,"May be I have visited far too many forts by now that when I visited the Taj Mahal, I had way too high expectations. No doubt the place is an architectural wonder given the time in which it was built and the amount of precision that went in to the construction. But thanks to the pollution nearby, the marble is no longer white, which takes away the breathtaking aspect.  Add to it the number of people trying to make money, it just spoils the overall experience. For example, I hired a photographer to take 2 photos at Rs. 50 each. He ended up taking 30 and trying to force me to buy 30 of them. When I said I only asked for 2, he said he would not give less than 30.  The ITC hotel outside is pathetic. Bad service, just about average food.  The govt. needs to really do something to get the place its glory. Fatehpur Sikri seemed much better in the present state."
30,Tajmahal,bad arrangement by Agra tourism,"Its a World Heritage sight! Its a wonder of the world! Its what people to india for! the travel from the car park to the monument is worst ever! Agra as a place is super hot so its not possible for families to walk 500 meters and up ! There is no proper management of the transportation provided by agra tourism developement. Stand in the heat..no queue system and when the vehicle arrives - people just push each other to get in! there are foreigners, old people, women and kids who are a part of this chaotic crowd! After standing in heat for more than 20 mins with no shade on your head you would not care of a needy person beside you!! people literally run over each other to get in those battery cars and golf carts. In the bus people are just pushed inside like stray cows....they are sweating nudging creating rucuss over seats....Its sheer rubbish! The monument is breathtaking but the arrangement is the worst and something that proves that india is a third world country!"
30,Tajmahal,Not that impressed,Went during the lower season so there wasn't a wait for anything. However still quite crowded. Went around 330pm. The price got raised to Rs. 1000 for foreigners. 3 of the minarets had scaffolding. Yes it is beautiful once you see it but there are people everywhere it's tough to get a nice picture. Upon entering the mausoleum you are basically shoved in. The security are blowing their whistles and yelling and you are forced to consistently walk in a circle around the tomb then out. There was absolutely no peacefulness. I wanted to experience the love and history devoted to this monument but it was hindered by the chaos. I also expected the details to be more impressive but it was mainly just plain white marble. I was far more impressed by the Akshardham temple in Delhi.
30,Tajmahal,Long queue for ladies,"We went early in the morning around 0600 am. They lanes are diveded in man and women. This is resulting in a much faster lane for gents - they anticipate women wear a handbag which needs to be screened for security reasons. I and my daughter did not bring a handbag but still had to stand in the lane for ladies, inefficient system. Your male companions have to wait for the women to get through. Considering one of the most visited places in the world, improve your efficiency! It is adviseable to put on mosquito repellent, a lot of mosquitos when you are in the lane. It was on our bucket list to see Taj Mahal but I will never come back here again. Agra is a dirty and unfriendly city,"
30,Tajmahal,Ok,"During our visit 3 of the 4 main pillars were covered in scaffolding. I realize that maintenance must be carried out although this took a lot of the beauty away from what should have been. Still a majestic sight. Don't worry about going early to beat the crowds, everybody is told this - therefore EVERYBODY will be there early with you!"
20,Tajmahal,I waited more,"I waited more. Very expensive, nothing interesting. Agra fort is more exciting and chipper. There are a lot of visitors."
45,Tajmahal,Not just a great piece of architecture but an eternal monument to an emperors love,"I remember reading somewhere that there are two kinds of people in the world. Those who have seen the Taj Mahal and love it, and those who have not seen the Taj Mahal and love it.  Easily one of the best known buildings in the world (various Armageddon, end of the world Hollywood movies depict destruction of India by a shot of the taj mahal being destroyed), the Taj Mahal is much more than just a building. Its a singular love story etched in the face of time. Its so majestic that its making a boring guy like me give a shot at eloquence to justify even 1/1000000th of the essence of the Taj.  Would want to give one practical suggestion. Avoid the guides. I feel if you really want to experience the Taj, take an audio guide easily available. that ways i feel instead of somebody bombarding you with facts and statistics at their pace, you can set your own tempo. Give time to the Taj - I spent 3 hours in the hot May sun and still it wasn't enough. and to satiate the tourist in you, do stand in queue for a photograph of you sitting on the famous Princess Diana bench - Price William and Princess Kate can't make this bench theirs. Bargain hard with the photographers. Best time to visit is undoubtedly in the mornings.  My bucket list has a new to do. To watch the taj bask in the full glow of full moon night."
45,Tajmahal,Nice place,Very Good place.... One of the most beautiful place I have ever seen... Enjoyed alot with frnds... Lot of masti all enjoyed very much....one of the most exciting summer vacation....
45,Tajmahal,Life Goal & Life Altering,"We came to India for this and will never forget it. The is was the apex of our seven days of travel through the golden triangle. It is a must see for people who appreciate culture, art, architecture and history. Do get an informative guide - we lucked out thanks to our driver AJay, who drive us through the triangle starting from Dehli. His close friend and certified tour guide was so pleasant, funny and informative. His name is Shubham Pandy - he has a page on trip advisor and you can contact him there to book with him. His price is very reasonable and he also found a a very reasonably priced professionally photographer for us as well - he took hundreds of photos and let us pick out favorites, printed and assembled them in an album, gave us the cd and a portrait size print for a very reasonable price - no haggling - he has a printed set price list that is more than fair. Shubham showed us all around, pointed out interesting aspects of the architecture and items of historical significance - his English is great and his personality is very charismatic:)"
45,Tajmahal,eve with the scaffholding (environental damage) this place is beautiful,"Awe inspiring. In particular, an evening view from the nearby park (sorry cannot remember the name). Colour changes with the light etc etc however it was the emotional impact for me. I just did not want to and, when I did, didn't dare to look-back"
45,Tajmahal,A must visit if you are in India,Taj Mahal is one of the best man made monuments in the World. If you are in India you must visit this place. It's about 2.5 hours drive in Yamuna Expressway from New Delhi. I stayed in a hotel just 600m away from Taj to enjoy the sunrise at 5:30 am.
45,Tajmahal,Wah Taj !!!,Should I say anything? It's world 's one of the seven wonders. You have to see it to believe it. You have to see the TAJ from morning to night. You will find different shades of it. You can see the TAJ from the other side of Yamuna river.
45,Tajmahal,The Crown of the World,"Grand, Iconic, Architectural Marvel, Symbol of Love, Brilliance of Imagination and Craftsmanship, Symmetrical & Flawless"
45,Tajmahal,Simply breathtaking !!,Taj Mahal doesn't need any introduction. The symbol of love and one of the seven wonders of the world is a must see places in India. We visited the Taj Mahal on our anniversary and it was indeed an awesome experience. It is closed on Friday and thus plan your visit accordingly. Would recommend a private tour since the packaged tours do not allow too much time to explore the place.
45,Tajmahal,Awesome,"Great monument, master piece. Fantastic, words cannot describe. You must visit once in a life time. Hfciytdiyrdyifcvv outfit. It'd. It dying. iYtfiyt. It city's"
45,Tajmahal,You MUST see it!,"The Taj Mahal is simply stunning to behold and cannot be left off your India itinerary! What an incredible testament to the craftsmanship of artisans in those years. Although my family would have loved to visit first thing in the morning - to catch the beautiful morning light, clearer air and significantly lower numbers of people - we could not arrive until a Thursday afternoon (and the Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays). Nevertheless, our experience was incredible. Our guide was most informative, sharing the amazing history of the Taj Mahal and he kept all of the family (1 x adult and 10, 16 & 18yo children) engaged.  If you get there later in the day, as we did, be prepared for photographers trying to sell you photo packages, loads of people trying to sell you trinkets of all types and LOTS of people (well, it is India after all). However, none of this should put you off the visit - the building is wonderful, the gardens are beautiful (and contain the tallest frangipani tree I've ever seen). You will not be disappointed."
45,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal wah Taj Wah Taj,To be honest it is really magnificent and so beautiful .It is rightly the 1st among the 7 wonders of the World.The architecture of the Taj Mahal is phenomenal .I had a wonderful time admiring the beauty of Taj can't get enough of it I am surely gonna plan another trip soon
45,Tajmahal,Breathtaking!,"I visited on the last day of the Muslim holiday, Eid-el-fatir so the crowds were heavy. It is truly spectacular and my guided many interesting facts about the history and construction. Loved it."
45,Tajmahal,Brought tears to my eyes!,With friends we traveled to India. The Taj was on all of our bucket lists and it did not disappoint. It is a stunning tribute to love and should not be missed. You will have to take off your shoes to enter but you are provided with booties.
45,Tajmahal,Truly spectacular,It was every thing and more than we expected. We arrived very early in the morning and saw it as the sun rose and then when the sun set from the other side of the river. Prepare yourself though for the crowds.
45,Tajmahal,Memories of love. .,"The Tazmahal is an ivory white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the yamuna river in the Indian city of agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the mughal emperor Shahjahan ,built in the memory of his wife Mumtaz mohal a persian princess. It is one of the seven wonders of the world"
45,Tajmahal,Beautiful View at Taj,"Amazing Scenery of Tajmahal, we have enjoyed a lot with fun nd joy, with Mr. Iqbal,/ Thnk you so much bro"
45,Tajmahal,Masti,"We all ""knew"" Taj Mahal! Tv and movies took it to everybody's home.  We only missed the details, and now we saw them... Wow!  The finely carved Marble Screen in only one large piece, the marble inlaid with precious stones, the harmony of the whole, enhance everything that is already said and written by everybody.  You just have to see it for yourself, as we did!"
45,Tajmahal,Just amazing!,"Noo need to describe Taj Mahal. It is just amazing! I would recommend to hire a guide. He was very helpful and he explained a loot of things. He also took some good photos of us, since he know all the good spots! Bargain for the good price!"
45,Tajmahal,Stunning !,"The reality way exceeds the photographs & TV documentaries ! It really is a stunning place which changes in appearance & mood with the light at different times of day. The building is beautiful taken as a whole but the detail is amazing & delicate. For maximum enjoyment, I recommend going with a good guide who will show you the best views & explain the history."
45,Tajmahal,Magic,I had hoped to visit the Taj Mahal for many years and so was overjoyed when the opportunity to be there came about. It was everything I thought it would be and much more. An incredible time spent there. Was a day I will long remember.
45,Tajmahal,"The Taj Mahal is magnificent, of course, but here are some important tips...","What can one say about the Taj? It's one of the 7 wonders of the world for a reason. But having recently visited, here are some tips that can hopefully help make your trip there better...  - Go early! We stayed in New Delhi, got up at 1 a.m. so that we were ready for our 2 a.m. departure time. A 3-hour drive in the middle of the night was not bad. The road to Agra from Delhi is smooth and new so we were able to sleep on the way. - Arrive in time for the gates to open at 5:30 a.m. First mover advantage! You get great photos without a lot of people around, and it's cooler in the morning, too. - Bugs are bad. Really bad. Before you go in, spray on some bug repellent.We wish we had. - Women, they only allow you to take in a small bag. No cosmetics (according to our tour guide). Take sunglasses - the sun is bright against the white marble! - If you have a trusty driver, leave your bags inside the car or in your nearby hotel room. - Visit from Oct to Apr if you can... July through Sept is unbearably hot. Apparently July is the worst... and that is when we were there. - Prepare to sweat. The humidity is really intense (and we live in Singapore, so we are used to humidity!). if you tend to sweat, wear a light-colored shirt so that your sweat won't be so noticeable in photos. My husband took an extra shirt along and changed after the Taj visit was over so that he didn't have to wear his sweaty shirt for the entire ride back to New Delhi. - Take along something to fan yourself with (small fan) - you will want to use it. - Take toilet paper and hand wipes- the bathrooms aren't well equipped, and you don't want to wash your hands with the water in the bathrooms. - Best photo tip from our tour guide: to get the best photos of the Taj reflecting in the water, be sure to squat down and shoot ""toward"" the water - you'll see a greater reflection of the magnificent structure that way!  Enjoy!"
45,Tajmahal,Cannot describe how I felt,"Seriously the world is divided by people who have seen the Taj Mahal and people who havent, Yes its busy, and hot but it is amazing and so very much worth seeing. Anyone who says its underwhelming is crazy - its the best!"
45,Tajmahal,Wow Amazing!!!,Incredible visit. Went at 6am during raining season. Perfect blue skies but hardly anyone there. We had an awesome guide who made the history come together and took some perfect photos for us. It really is one of the wonder so the earth. Such a long drive to get there but worth it.
45,Tajmahal,Stunning !!! No other words to describe it.,"The Taj Mahal is a breathtaking experience. The architecture, history and place is something different. As soon as you enter through the narrow corridor and see the Taj Mahal is like entering a new world."
45,Tajmahal,Lovely place,The 7 wonder of the world and this monument is one of them. Made of pure white marble by the great king for his wife. The monument is the national heritage and also UNESCO site. See the monument once and get mesmerized in the icon of love.
45,Tajmahal,Dream of shahjahan Taj Mahal,"Taj Mahal was dream of shahjahan. taj mahal based in agra uttar pradesh india . here totally used white marble. around taj mahal diesel car not allowed due to pollution problem. here using electric car , camel car , horse car , and cycle riksow to bring tourist to taj mahal gate from car parking. many tour guide are in car parking. and ticket window also in car parking. any electric item , match box, smoking item not allowed in side taj mahal.3 inference gate in taj mahal. must remember your car parking and gate no. lot of inlay work in taj mahal. with tour guide taj mahal tour is interesting."
45,Tajmahal,Breathtaking architecture,"This was really amazing. I recommend taking a tour guide to learn more. Some of the tour guides were very knowledgeable and speak perfect English. They will give interesting details of parts the architecture and history. Also, an advantage of taking a tour guide is that he will know the best spots to take photos. You will appreciate that when you look at the photos you took (or he took for you) later on your camera."
45,Tajmahal,Speechless !!!,"After the classical golden triangle we arrive Agra and the city its not close to fancy no clean no nice nothing!! My only thought was to see Taj Mahal and go. As we arrive on Friday when normally Taj mahal its close . we had to wait to next day for visit our guide suggest to to see sunrise so they picked us up at 430am , they drive us there and you make a special line for entry. Believe me when you the Taj and first ray of light starts touching the top it really looks that its full of diamonds!!!! we really where speechless!!!"
45,Tajmahal,The No. 1 place for couple,Tajmahal is not all about couple but it is all about family. Place should be visited in winter only. only water bottle and camera are allowed in Tajmahal
45,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal - A timeless tribute to Love,"Taj Mahal is a must see for anyone believing in love. It's sheer poetry. It is a way to experience love at first sight, once you enter from front and have a look at it.  Tickets can be booked online to avoid queues. Current price is INR 40/person.  Adequate car parking space is available (costs INR 80). Battery operated buses are available from close to parking area and ferry people to taj mahal (cost INR 10/person). Avoid hiring guides, who will try to woo you at car parking area. Avoid taking tongas (INR 150 for full) and rickshaws (INR 50 for full) in summer.  It opens around 5:30 AM during summer. Best time during summer is to visit in the morning. It becomes very hot during afternoon and is not recommended. You will not enjoy it in scorching heat.  Buy a water bottle from outside the campus, before you get into the queue. You cannot buy bottle from inside and also there is only one water point inside the campus.  At the time of writing this review, cleaning activity is ongoing and hence there are scaffoldings on 3 minarets. It does not provide an uninterrupted view.  Recommended to read about history of Taj Mahal on internet, if you do not intend to hire a guide. If indeed you want to hire a guide, consider hiring a licensed one and negotiate charges upfront.  Again, please avoid at noon time during summers, you may end up hating your decision. Otherwise it is pure bliss."
45,Tajmahal,Magnificent Monument,Truly one of the wonders of the world. The amount of visitors per day is mind boggling One can actually feel the love and dedication that was put into building this tomb A visit of a life time
45,Tajmahal,All about love,"It's so beautiful, especially the flowers on the wall are excellent.And enjoy the sunset of the building is nice view. The guide explain more details about Taj Mahal"
45,Tajmahal,Wonderful experience,This was my 4th visit to Taj but every time its feels i am here for the first time. Weather was a bit sticky at this point of year.
45,Tajmahal,Day Trip to Taj Mahal with Driver Rahul Sharma,We visited City of Agra and Taj Mahal with a private car and a Driver name Rahul Sharma from Ishu tours and travels. During our trip Rahul was extremely helpful and courteous and knowledgeable. He not only guide us during local shopping but also help us find better restaurant to eat at night time.Rahul Sharma is very trustworthy and honest person to travel with.
45,Tajmahal,Amazingly Beautiful,i do not have words to describe the beauty of Taj Mahal it is magnificent but the only challenge is that it is difficult to see from inside because its to crowded and cramped up.
45,Tajmahal,Worth the fame,Taj Mahal does not need a introduction and visiting the place is truly a good experience. The entire place is quite big and it takes around 2-3 hours to feel the place and enjoy it. It will involve quite a lot of walking and factor in the time to rest in between if you want to enjoy the place. The place is wheel chair accessible and wheel chairs are also available on request. Avoid going during the day time as the sun and the heat will add up to the stress. Prefer going early morning by 7 am as at that time the climate is good and the place is not crowded. By evenings the place would be crowded. Carry an Id Card with you as entry fee is different for foreigners and Indians and DI card is need to prove my nationality. Also note that Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays.
45,Tajmahal,Really amazing.,Go early or late in summer. Very hot and my kids did enjoy for sometime but later the heat took away the steel. Take a guide if you can. Too many people will come to help as a guide but take a government licenced on.
45,Tajmahal,Truly amazing,"A beautiful structure, the entire grounds is amazing. I do recommend using a guide as we discovered so much more than we would have known with out it."
45,Tajmahal,"Amazing, amazing and amazing","I didn't realize how beautiful this exquisite piece of architecture is until I saw it in real life. We went off-season in June when it was 45 degrees but it was worth it with less tourists. Also, easier to take pictures with less crowds and more time to see it's beautiful craftsmanship. Our guide was efficient in explaining everything and gave us plenty of time on our own to explore. We had many requests to take pictures with the locals, especially village people, because they don't see westerners. I know understand why it is the number one tourist destination. Everyone should see it!"
45,Tajmahal,Beautiful experience,"This place is amazing. I would recommend going on a weekday. We went on a Saturday and they clean the fountains on Friday so they were not all full. Also, try to get there slightly before sunset so you can see the change of colors when the sun hits the Taj. This will also allow you to avoid most of the crowds. This is a must see when going to India."
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,In Agra very beautiful place for tourism is Agar Taj Mahal.in this place very past story of mughal badsha. Here daily life of king and life style show
40,Tajmahal,The highlight of our trip,"we went to the Taj Mahal for the dawn tour @ 5.30 am. This for me was a great time to visit as we missed all of the hussle and bussle and didn't have to wait to get in. There were also no beggars around which made things more pleasant. We were accosted by one of the may ""professional"" photographers (i use that term very lightly) but in the end we agreed to let him take our photos. it cost us @ £20 for a small album of @ 40 photos with a disk to print off more copies if needed. The photos weren't the best quality but they are great to look back on and quite funny with some of the poses that we had to stand for. Visiting the Taj was great as there weren't many people about and you felt like you had it to yourself we were able to get all the photos in all the places we wanted with no hassle and had no bother getting to the Princess Diana seat which i thought would be a bit of a night mare. All in all this is a very worth while trip and the building itself is absolutely fabulous and much bigger and more awe inspiring in real life than i thought. having a good guide who can bring you though the complete history and explain everything to you is a must as we wouldn't have discovered or known half of what was in the area. I hope to return to this place one day."
40,Tajmahal,Amazing,"Words cannot describe the beauty Of this place. Needs to be seen to appreciate the beauty and workmanship involved. Be careful of ""guides"" and stick to reputed companies for tours"
40,Tajmahal,"Awe inspiring, surreal !","I've visited Taj Mahal more than twenty times, and every time the first view framed through the small doorway leaves me spellbound. Over the year's it has become crowded, as can be expected, but still a visit to Taj Mahal can be exhilarating. It is better to go early morning as it won't be crowded then. Hire a good guide as getting to know the history enhances the experience. Touts and photographers can at times be a nuisance and should be strictly ignored. Must see monument and a definite bucket list candidate !"
40,Tajmahal,Good views,Nice heritage site and one of seven wonders of world. One of the place to see before you die..  Nice views but very crowded place during weekend.
40,Tajmahal,Took my breath away,"We went during the off season expecting to have smaller crowds. There were very few foreign tourists which made getting into the Taj Mahal a breeze, but it was still packed with locals.  The white marble is beautiful from afar, but up close it is beyond amazing. Defiantly worth the 3 hour drive. Make sure you get a tour guide to explain the history of the Taj as well as guide you through the pickpockets and beggars."
40,Tajmahal,Mind Blowing,It's everything I've ever heard. It's beauty is mesmerizing. The White marbles the stones will make you wonder how could they built such an amazing establishment 400 years ago. The gardens surrounding the Taj only adds to it's beauty. But if you go there in summer I would suggest you go very early in the morning or late in the afternoon. Then you'll be able to enjoy without the sun bothering you.
40,Tajmahal,What a beautiful place!,"We took a guide to explore the Taj better than doing it on our own. He explained us everything very well, guided us on special paths without queue, took nice pictures of us. We had best experience using a guide!"
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful - a must see!,"Make sure to go early in the morning to beat the crowds - it opens in July at 5:30am. You can get a guide upon arrival - just make sure that they have a guide certificate. You will get hassled a lot on your way to the Taj Mahal - there is an approximately 500m walk from the street to the entrance of the Taj Mahal. Beware of petty theft - keep your valuables close. There are two entrances to the Taj once you go past security - one for foreigners and one for Indians (basically, foreigners pay 10x the price so they get less lines)."
40,Tajmahal,taj,"beautiful, inspirational and enchanted architecture. it's better to get there earlier, we were the first one to arrive at the place, do not bring selfie stick (or check to see if anything has changed). when living this magical place, you gets back to the reality of the population."
40,Tajmahal,Wonder of the world,"India is mix of chaos and beauty, and while it could be challenging for those more emotional, including myself, I would highly recommend you do it. It is mesmerizing, full of kind and beautiful people, and awesome food that make you come again. History is andoubtely capturing and very interesting too. This is a land of all religions, all people, and all nations. The level of tolerance is amazing and so inspiring."
40,Tajmahal,Visit at sunrise,"Obviously it's an incredible building and one of the highlights of India and the world. Make the effort and get up for sunrise if you'd like to avoid the mad crowds, but be advised, there will still be quite a lot of people there then!"
40,Tajmahal,Monument of Love,It's an architectural marvel situated on the banks of river Yamuna. It was built by Mughal emperor Shahjahan in the memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz. Visit the place for a wonderful experience.
40,Tajmahal,A Wonderful Piece in this World ! Just Incredible!,"A very beautiful, emotioal moment it was for me in Taj. i had read the stories behind this beautiful tomb, never was that touched until i saw it. The detail of craftmanship in every marble, the luxury it portrays which is embedded with various gems stones, so much of focus on making it the perfect and the most beautiful monument in this world. i just went back to history and started to imagine how wishful and devoted it was to ensure every bit of it was done to the best, how various marbles , gems were transported to this place from different parts of globe. Made me wonder does a bond called love give this strength and commitment to get this master piece done to perfection ! Very Very beautiful ! touched, amazed, excellent ! Must see in life time atleast once !"
40,Tajmahal,Impressive,We visited the Taj early in the morning. The queue for tickets was short (Rs1000 for foreigners). It took our breath away. Must visit.  Travel tips: 1/ No bags are allowed in the Taj. 2/ The audio guide was good!
40,Tajmahal,Wah Taj !!,Ever beautiful place is Taj to visit in India. We proud that such a lovely monument built in India. Simply Amazing.
40,Tajmahal,beautiful place,the place is very beautiful. best thing done by an man for a woman! every one should atleast visit taj once in their life to see its beauty
40,Tajmahal,Amazing and Incredible. Must do at sunrise,"Between slums and crazy extremes you find the Taj Mahal, India is such a land of extremes. This is the most deserving of the new 7 wonders of the world title and a must see. Whether in Delhi or Jaipur .. make the trip, and see the Taj ... amazing.  If you are ready to splurge, get a room at the Oberois to get a view of the Taj from your room. More than that, the hotel is also amazing.  Back to the Taj, I would recommend a guide that can steer you to all the favorite photo spots. Our favorite was the sunrise opening views as the scene was much less crowded. If you are first in line ... run in to the Diana bench and get a selfie with no one else in the background ... amazing."
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful,7 worlds of wonder are awesome but Tajmahal is awesome but always crowded with huge queues. Photography always inspiring
40,Tajmahal,taj mahal visit,i visited taj mahal( first time with my wife). it was just amazing. it is really very very beautiful. amazing piece of work. definately a must visit place for everyone.
40,Tajmahal,tranquil experience,"707 tours, Prem the Ramada Hotel driver, the most peaceful place in the world. You feel the love....."
40,Tajmahal,Hair Raising and Honest,"We booked a day tour with Akbran Tours to Agra from Delhi already from the States before we left on our trip. I contacted Sumit via e-mail and he was prompt with his responses and courteous with all e-mails. He had sent us an entire itinerary laying out all what would be offered that came with the day tour to Agra from Delhi a real full day.I had posted on TA Delhi forum looking for a tour operator and Sumits itinerary, price could not be beat by other competitors so I took the chance and it paid off we had a really nice day. We are a family of five in which we requested a van. The van was clean and spacious with a smooth ride down to Agra. The driver was also very courteous whatever we requested he made happen for us. If we need to stop for drinks we stopped for drinks. If we need to get out and stretch he found us a nice highway rest stop.There was no traffic going down until we hit Agra proper then we were stuck in this heavy non moving sea of cars because of a religious holiday that whole 2nd week of August and out of nowhere Sumit appears walked up to our car still in middle of traffic along with endless honking somehow is able to part these cars in front of us and we were out and free from this traffic direct to the Taj Mahal. He had set up an actual tour guide that met us that was well informed of the Taj along with helping us set up and take the greatest shots and angles for our photos.It turned out to be a wonderful day! Before I end this review I would like to make special mention of an incident. From all our belongings that we brought with us for the whole day was an expensive religious article of prayer my son brought with him and mistakenly left it in the van after we were dropped off not realizing he had left it in the car until at least an hour after the driver left us at the hotel. Only then after realizing it was left I What's App called and texted Sumit with the harsh reality that being at least an hours drive from us plus in such a wild and chaotic city like Delhi is we would never ever see this article again!!!!! The driver could have easily said there was nothing left in the van and even if would agree to the article being left in the van he already drove hours and hours why would he be crazy enough to come back another hours out of his way !! Sure enough Sumit assured me that he have his driver turn back for us and not to worry!! Sure enough that is exactly what happened and with in about a little more than an hour we had everything back in our possession without asking for any more charge. You can be rest assured even though he didn't charge us anymore we gave the driver a nice tip!! With this I recommend only to use Sumit and NO OTHER company for having a wonderful time and HIS AND DRIVERS HONESTY going completely beyond what was necessary!!! Jacob Florida"
40,Tajmahal,Wonderful,"A must go place. The trip is hard and takes time. At entrance a lot of people trying to seek you things. I recommend that you should take a guide and go with him - it will make your experience more enjoyable and safe - so you avoid people reaching at you all the time trying to offer guide tours stuff. Wonderful view, quiet and calm place. Perfect!"
40,Tajmahal,Wake up early and beat the crowd.,Waking up at 5am to beat the crowd was the best decision we made in our whole time in India. The other tourists we talked to all wished they had done the same. We got to really enjoy our time there and not have to wait or jostle to get good picture spots. I strongly recommend paying about 500 rupees to get a tour guide as you go through.
40,Tajmahal,Incredible,"Just like imagine it will be: a great, extraordinary experience. Only thing is that u do need mosquitos repellent. Especially for the entrance since you have to make a line and the streets are not that clean. Other than that: AMAZING.!"
40,Tajmahal,Symbol of Love.,As we all know its knows as Symbol of Love in worldwide. I visited it almost 3 time. I love this place very very much. Must visit place when You go to Agra. Too many people are there.
40,Tajmahal,Mesmerizing Taj...its such a beauty!,"The first time I saw the Taj, I was awed by its beauty and the ethereal whiteness against the backdrop of the blue skies - Its truly the seven wonders of the world! Amazingly beautiful!"
40,Tajmahal,Wahh Taj....,The symbol of love as it is said is truly a Wonder in the world and a true gift to people by Mughal emperor. One of the best creations that is worth watching and depicts the love of a person.  Wahh Taj boliye.....
40,Tajmahal,a must see in your life,"its a magical place that everyone should try to see. Its the best to come in early in the morning to avoid the crowd, and to take nice pictures."
40,Tajmahal,Wonderful Taj,No wonder it is among the Wonders of the World. Architectural marvel. Best seen during early morning.
40,Tajmahal,Trip of a lifetime,We visited at 6:00 am because it was so hot! That turned out to be an excellent & pleasant decision!
40,Tajmahal,Wow,Visited wid my mumtaaz and saleem... A great experience... honest and hospitable tourist guides... helpful attitude..
40,Tajmahal,Spectacular morning view,"We went there early morning and it was not very crowded. Beautiful, clean view. The only negative I saw was they didn't allow baby stroller along which made things bit difficult."
40,Tajmahal,Awesome Place to visit,Visit taj in evening with your mate for a mind-blowing experience. Dont forget to eat petha from panchi petha... chocolate petha was awesome
40,Tajmahal,A Dream come true..!!,"Its really amazing an experience when you get the first view of this great historic monument after waiting in the queue to get in. From the outside you get to see miniature view of the Taj and as you advance forward its like you lose your weight. It is an absolute wonder. Through out the way you can see people selling shoe covers. You don't really need to buy them from the outside. Inside you'll get the covers and also you have the provision to keep the footwear. The best time, it is said to visit the Taj is early morning, if you want to experience it in all in glory, though we didn't get a chance. We booked a package through Make My Trip and the worst happened to us. We didn't have our hotel bookings confirmed. Make my trip people assured us that the hotel is booked. But when it was time to check in, the hotel guys told its completely booked and not a single room is available. We were on the road in the middle of the night. And as it was season time it was very hard to find another place to stay. Finally the cab people helped us get a stay. Thank God! I would suggest every one to confirm you hotel and cab bookings in advance even though these people say there is no need for that. But I have to say the memory of the Taj was enough to forget all the hard time that we faced."
40,Tajmahal,Finally I Made it,One of the seven wonders of world! Good that we went with a guide inside (however he misguided us while doing shopping outside). One should surely visit this place.
40,Tajmahal,Gazing at The Taj Mahal,"This is truly one of the Wonders of the World. While many believe that this is the best depiction of what India is all about, my feeling is that there is so much more to see. The Taj is amazing but India is INCREDIBLE!"
40,Tajmahal,Must visit,"It's beautiful  Nothing to add !!  Must see it once in a lifetime !!  Though it is difficult to imagine the history and motive behind the building of a most expensive art work a Man can only make it once in a thousands of years to come, just like pyramids."
40,Tajmahal,Mesmerising and incredible,The Taj is one of the wonders in the world and you can only realise it once you see it with your eyes. You'll love the sight when you take the first glance to the beauty! Can't be expressed in words anymore...
40,Tajmahal,Wonder of the World.,Arrange a private guide and go early. By early I mean getting there at 5.45/6.00am. you can also view it from the opposite side of the river (where it was intended to have a black mausoleum). OCD or what! Suggest sunset for this.
50,Tajmahal,Welcome to the Taj,What's good  The Taj is majestic. The amount of marble put into it is equally staggering. The river bank is amazing. All in all one of those things to do before you die.  Whats not good  The crowd on weekends. Footwear management. One way routing that means thousands of steps.  What to do  Visit on a weekday if possible. Enjoy the grand structure. Take pics.
50,Tajmahal,Even more beautiful than shown in all pictures,The Taj Mahal is even more beautiful than those images shown in all pictures. The detailed contstruction as well as the emotional touch made me standing still in front.  Do not miss visiting the place at sunrise. You'll never forget this Monument of Love.
50,Tajmahal,"Taj Mahal, timeless master piece","I have been visiting Taj Mahal regularly over the last 15 years, however every time i visit, it feels like it is the first time I am seeing Taj Mahal. Such is the beauty of Taj Mahal."
50,Tajmahal,world wonder,great view of taj mahal must visit place if you visit agra always wish to see in moon ligth with the one who you love the most
50,Tajmahal,Expensive but worth it.,"Being a one of the seven wonder in your life time you should be worrying about seeing one of the time of your life and I did in June it was like really warm in agra and you should see my face when I am tripping all over with my own sweat but once I seen this white and marvelous architectural ancient building then I realise why people gives so much credit & for sure it's worth it. Amazing Indian & persian beautiful crafted design on the white Marbles and the Quran ayats as welcoming charms and the arrangement around it with the architecture and the garden represent the very creation of Heaven according to Al Bruni that is marvelous you should you should be prepared before going,so search about its knowledge representational Aspects so you can really have the real idea about the architecture & the knowledge behind it."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing visit..amazing monument,"Agra is a very good place to visit , of course Tajmahal is the sole reason but do visit other monuments too. If you are planning for the first time , book hotel in advance, there are many hotels both luxurious and budget. You can hire the taxis from your hotel, but remember to bargain hard. Also you can book an ola cab, if you are net savvy, it will save you money. Don't believe whatever the taxi drivers say, use your own mind while dining or hiring guides outside the monuments. You can get good guides in reasonable budget to show the monument's historical perspective. You can dine at multichain restaurants there like at Bilanerwala or at vangos or at pind Baluchi. Taxi drivers insist you to eat wherever they stop at. Beware usually these roadside hotels, restaurants or eateries are costly and serve poor food. It's my real experience. Carry water bottles and hats if you're planning to visit in summers."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing wonder of the world!,"On 13th June I visited this fantastic monument with three friends. We had booked a tour guide which was useful for showing us around. It was a very hot day- it reached 44 degrees Celsius whilst we were there. The Taj Mahal itself was wonderful and it was difficult to comprehend its size. The surrounding mosque, buildings, gateways and gardens were beautiful too. As a word of warning, be prepared for street vendors outside of the Taj and many locals took photographs of us once we entered the gateway. However, I would definitely recommend visiting this amazing site!"
50,Tajmahal,"Iconic, busy but fantastic",This is one of the places in the world that gives you shivers up your spine when you first enter through the gates and see it. It is everything that you read about.
50,Tajmahal,Amazing monument,Amazing monument. It was very hot and humid in June. We tried to beat the heat by visiting early morning at 6 and with some clouds in sky on that day we were able to stand the heat. Take your water bottle with you and also buy the shoe covers (available for Rs 10/ pair - many seller selling this there) so that you dont have to remove shoes.
50,Tajmahal,First and last visit,"Too many people have visited and reviewed. Beware of guides, photographers. The ticketing agents outside are very rude. Don't forget to carry identifications (Indian) for ticketing or they will give you a hard time just because they can. Buy shoe covers as removing shoes and walking on hot stone is not advisable. Just try to enjoy the gardens and the river view. Have good time all."
50,Tajmahal,Wow Taj !,"many people strive hard to visit places out of their home country, but they should realize the importance of looking for places within their country. One example of that is Taj Mahal. The beauty of India. No one can ever deny the fact on why this was still on the wonders of the world. The time you enter inside the monument, oh god, classic and deep feeling which can't be expressed in words. Great work. Ideal time to be there is during evening as during Hot son you don't have space to hide :)"
50,Tajmahal,Awesome TAJ.,"Must visit place. Awesome and Amazing.... Pride of INDIA. In summer time, When you go inside buy pair of white shoe cover outside the main gate itself as not available inside and you dont have to open shoes as the marble stone is very hot in summer time. No need of a guide for this property. For good photography go in morning time when crowd is less."
50,Tajmahal,Wonderful,After visiting Tajmahal I realised why it is call one of the world's wonder. It's very relaxing environment inside the place.
50,Tajmahal,Amazing,Really amazed with the beauty of Taj Mahal... Enjoyed a day with my family... It's closed on Friday..
50,Tajmahal,Taj Trip,Taj is mesmerizing. The moment you first see it feels like a dream. A visit in winters will be more fun. I visited in June and the Agra heat takes a toll on you after some time.
50,Tajmahal,Deserves all the hyperbole,"People will tell you its crowded, hot and you'll be permanently accosted by street vendors. Yes, it is hot, can be crowded and the vendors can certainly be annoying outside the monument.  It really is stunningly beautiful. The gardens are wonderful and the building itself amazing.  You can't go to this part of India and not go. A must see."
50,Tajmahal,Dan of Love,Visiting Taj at the early hours of the morning is an experience by its self. Not only it is less crowded but also the monument brings out the feeling of Shahjahan in a more elegent manner
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal The Great,"Taj Mahal is AWESOME. Superb!! Don't miss it. The best part of visiting Taj Mahal is, you can go to the central structure and see the splendid architecture from very close. In fact you can touch, sit, walk on the white stone structure. Taking photo allowed but video is prohibited without proper permission."
50,Tajmahal,Simply fascinating!,"While working a few weeks in Delhi, we found some time to take the highway to Agra, and I can't believe how cool it was to see the Taj Mahal. What a thing of beauty, and the stories about it are fascinating. We paid for sort of a ""quick pass"" to bypass the LONG line. Whatever it was, it seemed to work as we never waited long at all. Take your time, enjoy the beauty and take lots of photos!"
50,Tajmahal,Wonderful,"It is a must see. Save enough time to walk around and contemplate the beauty of this place. We went during the morning and stayed until past noon, but a good advice for people would be to try to go later in the evening because Ive noticed in others peoples pictures that the colour changes and its way better in the evening sun!"
50,Tajmahal,Even better than you imagine,"I visited during the early morning, and had a wonderful time in the Taj Mahal, and in the garden. The garden itself was wonderful, and the Taj was a revelation. Definitely worth traveling there."
50,Tajmahal,Unforgettable! Amazing!!,"This is one sight I looked forward to seeing and worries I might be disappointed, but oh my, this place is so wonderful. There really is no way to describe the beauty. Be sure to go at sunrise. First the lighting has such an interesting effect on the marble of the building. Additionally the crowds are lighter and you have a chance to pause and view without large groups."
50,Tajmahal,Wonder of the world,There is nothing to say about this wonder of the world. A must must visit place for the couples. A symbol of love. A photogenic place where you can click as many as photos. Plan to visit at full moon night to see the true beauty.
50,Tajmahal,Majestic,"Do I have to say anything about this monument!!! Majestic is one thing that comes to mind. Best time to visit is early morning or during cloudy weather. Try avoiding during hot sunny weather, you might fail to enjoy the beauty."
50,Tajmahal,Eternal Beauty,"Taj is by far the best tourist attraction in India. Situated on the banks of river Yamuna, it is like a white pearl mounted on earth. One should plan a trip to Taj by Sunrise and witness the different flavours of beauty it presents through the Sunrise. Visiting at sunrise also helps in avoiding the huge rush of people. Another advice is not to go for any local guides and instead pre-book your guides from authorised tour operators."
50,Tajmahal,Couldn't imagine it to be so beautiful..!!,I have traveled a lot but this was my first time with the Taj.. The narrow lanes to the way to the Taj kept my expectations very low.. But then once I entered the Tan complex and had a look at the Taj - I couldn't believe how beautiful it is.. It I'd the most beautiful monument I have ever seen in my life.
50,Tajmahal,Simply Majestic 'Word cannot define',"Simply Majestic 'Word cannot define' the monument of love, I feel privileged to been there, undoubtedly must visit place in lifetime.  I believe that The Taj Mahal better to explore with audio guide to feel connected with true love of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan."
50,Tajmahal,marvelous.,"Few tips to make the trip memorable:  Take audio tour guide only .The local guide are always in hurry. Take shoe cover, as these cover are not availble after entry gate. If you do not want hard copy of your photo, do not hire any professional photographers. Maxm of them are not professional protographers and the photo quality is too bad. Start in the morning to avoid crowd,Hot & Humid climate. Avoid the Meen bazar recodemended by the tuk tuk/camel/horse drivers. The same item are available in local market at 1/3 of the cost. Only buy agra petha from Panchi petha store. Becareful for the duplicates Only go to the resturants by checking the reviews in tripadviser."
50,Tajmahal,The Taj - Need I say more?,"The Taj - Need I say more? The cleanliness around the monument seems better during this visit. Less people bothering us with offers of photographs etc., Improving in terms of attracting world travellers, with good practices implemented."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing experience!,We went at 7 am and already there were many people there. It was very hot and humid. We had a hired guide who took us around and talked about the history. It truly was an amazing experience.
50,Tajmahal,The mesmerizing experience,"I think, no introduction is required for THE Taj Mahal. Enjoy its beauty and soak in its monumental historic events occured around it. Though everything is known for this place, but beware of the touts here. You can hire photographer, but have a clear deal. Same with the guide. Guides have tie-up with the shops outside, so they will get commission if you buy. You can make some token purchases, but be very cautious for expensive buy. The materials can be fake. The city is full of crooks, so beware from purchases everywhere."
50,Tajmahal,Beautiful,"The Taj was one of the most beautiful sites that I have ever seen. No trip to India can be complete without a visit to the Taj.  I highly recommend a tour guide.  Also, Agra is not exactly close to any major city that you would likely fly in to. Accordingly you will need a driver. A recommend a private driver as it is very cheap and much quicker than other group travel. If you are coming from Delhi there are two road options. Make sure that your driver takes the toll road as it is much quicker and safer!"
50,Tajmahal,Dream come true,The experience was very interesting. It was like a dream come true. There were a lot of people to visit. Would recommend if you are going to Agra
50,Tajmahal,Majestic monument,This really was one of the best experiences on our trip to India. The monument is cleverly framed by the gates/ entrances. We arrived before sunrise. The building really glows bright. The stones inlaid in the marble is another special feature to this amazing building.
50,Tajmahal,Good memory,"Good memory but the worst time to visit. It was very hot day of June. Had to visit, best time would be in winters."
50,Tajmahal,100% must do in India,"I paid for a local private tour guide once I arrived, he was arranged by my driver that I hired from Delhi. Just like everything in India, the cost was reasonable and the experience was well worth it. Our guide gave us history about the surrounding fort, the Taj itself and the local area.  I've heard that the weather is hit or miss, it could be cloudy or hazy but I lucked out with pure blue skies. The courtyard gets packed quickly, so try and arrive as early as possible. The inside of the Taj Mahal isn't really that interesting by the Taj itself is perfection. You will definitely have a ""can't believe I'm here"" feeling, even if you're the most seasoned traveler."
50,Tajmahal,Fantabulous !!!,"What a beautiful structure !! awesome. An ode to the technology and skill of the times, simply superb ! did you know that the 4 pillars are constructed at a outward slanted angle so that even if they fall, they will fall outward and not damage the Taj !!! The semi precious stones inside glow when we shine a torch on them from close !! Looks different at sunrise, sunset and during full moon!! Many other sites in the complex and many stories. Do hire a guide...beautiful."
50,Tajmahal,"Lives up to the hype, and then some","More than worth the visit. Go at sunrise to avoid heat and crowds; be prepared for a line and security screening at the entrance. It's worth paying for the ""high value ticket"" for an expedited entry experience (still only about $10)."
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj Wah....,"Mesmerizing moments to visit this historic monument... many told-untold stories on this monument.. but yes, one must visit at lease once in a life..."
50,Tajmahal,Magnificent structure.,"Do not go in summer, early morning is still ok. Take plastic cover to put on your shoes, otherwise you have to take them off.2-3 hours are enough"
50,Tajmahal,"Mystical, magical Taj","Since it was Friday, the holy day for Muslims, the Taj was closed to tourists and the usual view was unavailable. The gates were closed. Our driver took us to the back along the Jamuna River where we caught a boat across. Seen from this less known perspective, the Taj had a special magic the day we were there. Instead of it being just a ""better than nothing"" trip, it was a memory for a lifetime. If time permits, go to the back of the Taj as well as the front."
50,Tajmahal,Wow!,I changed my trip plan in India just to include this master piece! I am so happy that I decided to go there. This building is for sure one of the 7 world wonders. A bit unfair the difference in the ticket fee requested to foreigners (1000INR) but it worth the price. An experience you will never forget.
50,Tajmahal,The Symbol of Love,"Taj Mahal or the symbol of love is more than just an attraction and strikes you with great architecture, symmetry and grandeur. The city that was the capital of Mughals saw this great monument dedicated to the queen Mumtaz by the then king Shahjahan. It took about 20 years to construct the monument and it has been humbling us eversince. A must visit for everyone in the country and maybe the world. Avoid May and June afternoons as they can be taxing because of the heat. What to do when visiting Taj Mahal - Keep yourself hydrated, it can be really hot. Opt for the socks, always - they save your feet. Keep enough memory space in your camera / smart phone Spend sometime watching the river Yamuna and the Red Fort Try watching the Taj Mahal from across the river, if possible - specially from July to September when the water level is good enough. Do not miss visiting Fatehpur Sikari while you are in Agra."
50,Tajmahal,Absolutely beautiful,Taj mahal is an architectural marvel. Its absolutely beautiful but currently the minars are under some kind restoration by ASI due to which the pictures taken are that beautiful.
50,Tajmahal,Truly an amazing experience!,"The Taj certainly lives up to its reputation as one of the 7 wonders of the world. Looking at the beauty of the structure and understanding the story behind it, this is unbelievable!"
50,Tajmahal,Just a weekend trip,"After a long period of expectation, finally went to Taj Mahal as an Indian. As a world wonder, it don't have much in my point of view. But for photographs, we can plan a trip here. Just like other popular places, things are costly around taj mahal. So be alert"
50,Tajmahal,Taj Beauty of India,Gem of a place in India. Worth spending a full day in Agra. Friday is off so please make sure you plan your visit in advance. Highly Recommended.
50,Tajmahal,A must see while in India,This place was gorgeous! It's a must see while you're in the country. The ticket process was easy. We got to the ticket station just before 5 am. We took the free bus to the entrance. Not far so you could have walked.  No touts/hagglers/wannabe guides here. Very easy process.  So gorgeous to witness with your own eyes.  Get there first thing in the morning as it fills up quick and there will be tons of people in all your pictures
50,Tajmahal,Amazing,"Overwhelming experience to hear the history while visiting this world wonder #1. June was very hot, take a lot of water with you & spare memory cards for the camera!!!"
50,Tajmahal,No words for Taj Mahal,"I can't say any word for Taj mahal . It's a wonder of da world . It's just a amazing . There are many hotels in agra with Taj Mahal view , please don't go for the gateway hotel taj agra ."
50,Tajmahal,The most beautiful building in India,"Taj Mahal is one of the few sights which really lives up to your expectations, it's spectacularly beautiful. We went there on a private tour with Amin Tours, which was the right choice, considering how hassle-free everything was. Going there on our own we would have spent hours waiting in numerous queues."
50,Tajmahal,"What more can ever be said, fantastic","We arrived at 5 pm, overcast and 34 degrees, perfect ! We expected crowds and rip off! But this exceeded every expectation, it was easy and quiet, very serine , we reluctantly agreed a photographer that took 160 photos , we haggled and got a printed album and a cd with all pics for 25 pounds, great value, but haggle, this is the must for any trip to India, FANTASTIC"
50,Tajmahal,Wah TAJ !!!,The TAJ stands out as a true symbol of Love & Glory .The first glimpse of the Monument itself leaves you spellbound.
50,Tajmahal,Worth the hype!,"Have seen many of the wonders of the world and this is worth all the trouble. Must see this in person, once in your life if you can make the trek to Agra. Yes, it's crowded, dirty in the area, all the complaints are true. Still...MAGIC!"
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal fantastic,visited early morning for the sunrise view we stayed very close to the Tajmahal so it was easy to walk down to taj its was one of the most amazing moment when we were in front Taj must Visit for every one .
50,Tajmahal,Fantastic,"Seeing the Taj Mahal for the first time was a dream come true. Although the place can be too crowded, I still had an amazing time exploring the whole site. The place also has beautiful gardens. Better visit Taj Mahal in an early morning."
50,Tajmahal,Good family outing,Enjoyed the Taj & Agra Fort. It was hot the day we were out but it didn't dither us. The battery car should be encouraged.
50,Tajmahal,Its my fouth time.,"Its always different. How i don't know. Now, I have seen all entry gates. Good to approach Slip gram one as it have parking and easy window for tickets and Electric bus to Taj."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing Monument,"No wonder it is one of the seven wonders in the world, amazing place, one of the most beautiful place we have visited. You have to see it to believe, please beware of you valuable when you enter the tomb. if you are staying in Delhi, suggest you leave you hotel before seven in the morning to avoid the traffic."
50,Tajmahal,Awesome EYE Treat,Incredible tour of Taj Mahal and Agra fort. The Taj Mahal must be seen in person to get the total perspective of its beauty. The transport driver and tour guide were very good. They also took me to a few artisan shops where I saw stones being shaped just like those inlaid in the Taj. Excellent overall tour.
50,Tajmahal,everything I had hoped it would be and more,"I stayed at the Oberoi Amervilas. I had asked the hotel to organise my tour guide and had specifically requested Mohammed Rizwan of Elite Solutions based on tripadvisor reviews. I met him in the Lobby at 5:15am and together we took the little buggy to the Taj, which was everything I had hoped it would be and more.  At this time of the morning there were only a few visitors and the way the marble glowed with the early morning light was unforgettable."
50,Tajmahal,Marvellous !!!!!!!!!!,A marvel monument created from white marble stones and decorated with precious stones. The creativity is unique of its kind and one should visit at least once. Words are not sufficient to describe its beauty.
50,Tajmahal,Eternal Love Monument ( mausoleum ),"Built by Shah Jahan as an eternal symbol of his love for his favorite wife, whom he called Mumtaz Mahal.  The Taj adores exquisite detailing covering every inch of marble intricately carved floral bouquets are inlaid with precious stones: agate, jasper, malachite, turquoise, tiger's eye, lapis lazuli, coral, carnelian and different shades of marble, slate, and sandstone were used.  Towards the center lies Mumtaz Mahal's cenotaph with the words HELP US OH LORD TO BEAR WHAT WE CANNOT BEAR.  The cenotaph has intricate carving from inside and one can see the Indian jali tradition here. The screen is topped with ornamental crenellations, kanguras, consisting of vase-shaped elements alternating with openwork formed of volutes of acanthus leaves, crowned at their juncture by small vase elements.  And that justifies it as a wonder of the world.  Visiting Taj:  The Taj is open for night viewing for 5 days each lunar cycle: the full moon night and the 2 nights before and after. These after-hours sessions happen between 8pm and midnight and are highly regulated. Once should arrange to see the Taj around 10pm on these days. Besides the regular daytime visits.  TIPS:  1. Ask your hotel to arrange tickets for night time visit. 2. Ask your hotel to arrange for qualified Tour Guide / Official Tour Guide ( highly recommend by me. )"
50,Tajmahal,One of the best place of india,"I like each n everything of Taj Mahal, It has great view nicely clean charming, I love to visit again."
50,Tajmahal,History speaks its beauty,The beautiful monument which is actually the heart of India. Its the best place to see the old construction of Mughal Empire. Peaceful and beautiful piece of love and affection. For indians Tajmahal is must watch as people from all around the world come india to visit it. Also try to go in cold weather. Avoid April to June timing
50,Tajmahal,"Taj always lives upto the expectations, it is a masterpiece!","Taj always lives upto the expectations, it is a masterpiece! Advice for local travelers (Indians!), here you need to prove your identity so please carry a photo ID. Else the people (from the ticket counter to the people at the entry point) are all under government directive to make money. If you do not have a photo ID, you can still get into the Taj (or any other monument) but have to buy the so called ""High Value Ticket"" - INR1000 (rather than INR40 for Indians and INR540 for citizens from SAARC nations). Again it is not a security issue but just a commercial issue where the state government is trying to make money, we all know for what!"
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,An obvious stop in Agra. I went for a sunrise shot but did not find it to be that much better than during the day. I really liked taking shots and viewing it from across the river.
50,Tajmahal,best wonder of the world,it is the best wonder of the world and i have been to this place with my wife. shahjahan built this monument for his wife mumtaaz. it is must visit place
50,Tajmahal,Amazing monument.... Will suggest to take guide along,Amazing white marble monument.... Suggest to hire a guide and he will tell you some amazing facts and then you will actually come to know why this is amongst 7 wonders of the world.... Must visit agra Fort after this... You will connect the dots... Must take sun glasses during sunny day
50,Tajmahal,Very nice,I have visited this with my friends. Wat to say unbelievable experience. Love this place. Must visit.
50,Tajmahal,Breath taking,"Go at 5 in the morning if you can and wish to click it away. A life time is not enough to capture it's beauty and it is beautiful beyond imagination in real life. Though extremely crowded and it's marinates under renovation, the tourists are most insensitive about others and the fact that they should not come within photo frames. They give disposable shoes and the insensitivity is embarrassing. Taj definitely calls for more, much more respect."
50,Tajmahal,surreal,amazing experience. I had a great guide who explained the history behind the taj mahal which was very informative.He then explained the rules of entering the mahal and what to look for so on entering the taj mahal it was fantastic. the building it self is magnifienct with inscriptions which have some meaning. For me it was a once in a life time experience and it was well worth it.
50,Tajmahal,Wow Great Experience,"I have been here many times , its a great experience always. Great Landscaping hats off to Old Architecture . Maintenance work of Taj is going on but one thing was very disappointing that plastic waste was scattered here and there.Small plastic pouches of shoe cover were flying around the Taj . Plastic must be banned at any cost, it's our moral responsibility to keep it clean. Above all it was a memorable visit. Wah Taj............."
50,Tajmahal,Avoid in Summer and on weekends,"In summer, it is very hot and you have to wait for some time to actually reach at Taj. So avoid in summer and weekends as there is lot of crowd and you cant enjoy the Taj in that crowd."
50,Tajmahal,Most memorable place of my life,I will never forget my visit to Taj Mahal. It was month of April and i travelled Agra with my wife.We stayed very close to Taj Mahal so that we can go to this place whenever we want and can see the beauty of Taj from the terrace of our Hotel.Its wonderful architecture and every pillars store in it tells the story of the greatness of this place.I would recommend everyone to visit Taj Mahal atleast once in life.
50,Tajmahal,Taj is sartaj of whole world,"I have gone Taj Mahal with my family. surrounding of Taj having peace and you can sit over benches. you should see the beauty of Taj, sprit and love behind construction of Taj. Best place ever to visit."
50,Tajmahal,Awsome truesome,All I can say it's a must visit as many times as possible. When we went there some maintainance was on of one of the four pillars of the Taj Mahal. So the pictures were not that great. But maintenance is must...the pictures can take a back seat.
50,Tajmahal,It was amazing trip,i visited taj mahal during my holiday and i seen some amazing facts about taj mahal....there is underground gate in the middle of taj which open once in a year...i listen some surrounding sounds in the taj....i seen photo of mumtaj backside of taj on the stone...overall it was amazing trip for me.
50,Tajmahal,Most beautiful,"I visited Taj Mahal on Aug 2015 it's most beautiful,I never ever seen such a beautiful historical place. Every one must visit Taj Mahal"
50,Tajmahal,Amazing Experience,"We arrived very early in the morning, as the facilities were opening, and this allowed us to have the Taj to ourselves. We enjoyed the changing color of the building as the sun rose. Simply a most memorable experience."
50,Tajmahal,As beautiful as it seems in photos,"Well, we reached agra late in the evening and were informed that Taj is 6AM to 6PM only. So, we planned an early morning trip to it and reached at 5:45 on the east gate. Took a nice Tonga to reach the main gate and it was so beautiful, serene and peaceful at that time. So, I really don't know what to add more because there is so much to it and you gotta visit it to find out. Stay away from unauthorised guides, water and food. Buy Tickets in time, Take a Tonga and don't fall for premium tickets prices claims."
50,Tajmahal,Worth a visit!,I went to the TAJ Mahal after 20 years and it looked the same! it is awe inspring architecture. Take a guide when you visit as the guides can explain so much more than what you would see on your own. Try going early morning to beat the rush. Still be prepared to be in the queue for entry as not all scanning machines work and the queue builds up.
40,Tajmahal,Tourism,Visiting TAJ mahal early morning before sunrise was amazing experience !! Serene and peaceful... There was peace and purity in environment....
40,Tajmahal,Taj still takes the breath away - even after multiple visits,"Sad state of affairs - Taj seems to be losing its sheen day by day, But still doesn't stop from enchanting the traveller. Spend time looking at the amazing scale and proportion. Agra is still a sorry little example of a town. Construction activity continues to happen around Taj. The fort is majestic. A nice one night escape from Delhi via Yamuna Expressway - Trident Agra is a very good hotel option with great service quality and is attractively priced."
40,Tajmahal,Go early to beat the crowds,"Go at sunrise to beat most of the crowds. It is a beautiful building, a must see location if you are going to be in this area of India. Be aware that it is currently having maintenance done on three of the towers which does detract from the visit."
40,Tajmahal,Amazing India,"When you visit India Thai Mahal is a MUST! It's 350 years old. It took them 22 years to build it. It's built of white marmor with small figurers of black marmor. It's a hugh building, butiful and amazing. The surrounding is also butiful - the river and parks around."
40,Tajmahal,Masterpiece,The built is truly commendable with the lovely white slabs with carvings. Beautiful sculptor and definitely deserves to be called a wonder of the world.
40,Tajmahal,Timeless beauty!!,Needs no review apart from the fact that two minarets are undergoing restoration..so spoils the photos a bit at this point of time
40,Tajmahal,The Taj,Beautiful building when you are next to it. Totally different from when you have seen the normal picture.Amazing workmanship.
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,Taj Mahal Is Very Interesting Place To Visit And To See Beautiful Scenery. The Place Is Very Beautiful And This Place There Will Be Daily Visitors To See The Beauty Of Taj Mahal Extraordinary Experience
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful wonder,"The photographers & tour guides make the visit a chore, but if you find a good guide who will explain the visit appropriate to your interest, then this can be a fantastic experience."
40,Tajmahal,Visit to The most Beautiful wonder of the world,You will need to park ur vehicles a little away. People are reqd to buy tickets. Can carry ur cameras. Charged. Security is tough but smooth. Normal waiting. Not much delay. Fixed people per trip. A battery operated bus takes people to the destination. CISF people are wd you. Once at the destination..... you feel amazing. All the trouble is worth it. Better to hire an authorised guide to learn abt the monument. Rates are fixed for certified guides. You can click pics. Amazing experience.
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal: The Wonder of India,"Taj Mahal is the nice travel place in India that is an ivory-white marble mausoleum at Agra. This is nice place to visit, if you are going to India."
40,Tajmahal,Everything you'd expect it to be,"Get up early and be the first in through the West Gate, if you want good photos without the crowds and a nice sunrise. Away from the Taj itself, the grounds remain calm and cool, and as well as the bottle of water they give you on entry, there is a drinking water dispenser (take a portable filter straw if you're concerned) so if you have time it's a nice place just to sit and read. I downloaded a free guide (Captivatour app) which helped me enjoy it more. One criticism - I was literally the first person through the gate, but the grounds were littered with rubbish from days or weeks earlier. Not really acceptable for such an important site, it would take only a few members of staff and very little expense to address this (revenue from only 1 tourist ticket per day would pay for over 10 people)."
40,Tajmahal,"Beautiful, crowded , avoid during summer","I have visited 2-3 times , no doubt great architecture of marble made, located bank of yamuna river, In day trip to agra, Fatehpur sikri , sikandra can also be covered"
40,Tajmahal,Story that has foundation and the building which makes it a Monument!,"Everyone just focuses on this Monument's base beginning but reality lies in it's foundation, construction and story! This monument is more than one can think of! Love is obviously the reason but beyond that this monument is also a sign of science, development, culture integration, strength of love over strength of money! Foundation is made of Deodar Tree Wood which strengthens with the flow of water that runs beneath it! Height of Taj is equivalent to Foundation depth! Number of domes at Entrance gate is equivalent to number of years it took! It's symmetrical from inside out view. It's not marble that make is luminescent but it's stone engraved into it that makes it worth shining. Persian labour and Indian Labour together made it possible to erect this building to become monument! You ll always know more about it as Stories lie in there and its in the air :)"
40,Tajmahal,Stunning building with a romantic twist!,"I've been to the Taj a few times now and it never fails to impress me. An obvious symbol of true love; fantastic architecture which brings cultures together and a magnificent monument to happiness, which is evident from all of the smiles adorned on all the faces I saw whilst people watching.  I found the best way to experience the Taj was to go with the locals, and see how they do, with love, admiration and amazement!"
40,Tajmahal,Mesmerising......,"We have been visiting Taj since a couple of years and it always looks fresh and mesmerising. However, the recent restoration and construction outside the Taj is affecting its health."
40,Tajmahal,Trip to Taj,"It was a nice experience , quite hot though, traveling with the kids is quite hard, especially with mine . Very nice place with lots of wonderful artwork . A must visit place once in a life time .  Renovation and construction work during my trip bit disturbed me, otherwise it's a trip to remember ...."
40,Tajmahal,Much awaited The Taj,"Pros Masterpiece art with historical image of love and affection  Cons  Touts are everywhere , below average maintenance , toilets are horrible , water system is useless , very much crowded on weekend"
40,Tajmahal,nice Place for visit,"very nice & good place to visit with family, its very wonderful to see the Taj mahal in moon night, must visit this place."
40,Tajmahal,You need realistic expectations,Although it seemed smaller than I imagined at first walking up to it changed that impression. The Taj Mahal is beautiful but the crowds can make it an less than stellar experience. Try to go at an off time. Use your imagination to find quieter spots and to conjure up the place as it was. The inlay is amazing.
40,Tajmahal,Beauty At the Best...!!!,"This is among the seven wonders of the world and it really deserves to be...!!!  Even when built in such an old time... the architecture is really awesome... The building structure, the geometry and the natural principles used in the architecture is really amazing....  The monument is perfectly symmetrical and has 0% deviation.  Yeh guides are easily available. Who can share the history and to show around.....a must visit heritage..."
40,Tajmahal,"Fantastic building and a rather tempestuous history, shame about the rubbish.","Lovely place. Beautiful building and with the story behind it, a symbol of great love. Even more interesting, having learnt the story behind the building and how it affected India and the monarchy there.  Enjoyed the visit overall but was very disappointed with the rubbish strewn around all over the place. I couldn't understand why the bins were fully packed with rubbish and overflowing with it when I arrived there before the place opened (at sunrise). I suggested to our Guide that the rubbish could've been collected after the Taj Mahal was closed to tourists the evening before or a body was allocated to come and empty the bins before opening at sunrise. The guide was affronted and told me it was the rain that cause the rubbish to be strewn. That didn't make sense as the rubbish was everywhere and the bins (as I said) and reiterate were packed and overflowing.  As I said, beautiful monument, shame about the rubbish."
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful but Agra is unpleasant,"Obviously an awe inspiring building, easy to understand why it's one of the wonders of the world! We happened to be there when monsoon rains struck but it didn't detract from the beauty of the Taj.  My only disappointment is that obviously the local government are aware that people will come to see the Taj regardless of how much effort they put into keeping the city clean and modern, so Agra itself is pretty decrepit. Such a shame."
40,Tajmahal,Dream,The visit here is a dream. The story of love is one of the best and famous around the world.A must for anyone. The building is marvellous.
40,Tajmahal,Amazing,interesting if you take a guide so you can listen to all history real and factual also he will double up as a good photographer and will show good views.Guide price can be bargained we asked the same guide to accompany us to agra fort.
40,Tajmahal,Historic cleaning!,"Took a day trip from Delhi to Agra (via Agra day tour packages). Although bloody hot in June, still worth a visit especially because less crowded. Visited on a Monday which is recommended too - weekends and public holidays are apparently the worst. Two of the pillars were being cleaned - for the first time in +300yrs so quite special actually. It doesn't make the place less impressive. In fact, interesting to see the difference between the cleaned and not cleaned parts. Must see when in Delhi/Agra."
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful monumet,"try to visit it on friday night when it looks blue or at sun rise.with orangish look..plan the trip in a manner to avoid afternoon heat n crowd-early morning , sunset or ""only Friday: nights. the tickets for friday night view are very limited and need to be booked in advance."
40,Tajmahal,"Very Clean, Hard To Get To","The Taj is likely one of the most beautiful classic sites of the world that you really should visit. Often with these classic sites when you see them in real life, over a postcard, you're disappointed, but the Taj does not disappoint.  It's also a very comfortable place to walk around. India can be hectic, and there are always people around to sell you things, or beg for money. Fortunately the Taj is closed off from this and walking the grounds is very relaxing. The one problem with the Taj depends on how you get in. The ""entrance"" to the Taj is in fact nowhere near the Taj itself. It's several blocks away, and requires you take a bus or golf cart to get to it. This means that between the entrance building and the Taj there are many people ready to sell you things (from trinkets to tours), and you'll have to endure some of the Indian sun. Even if you have a driver, they are unable to let you come right up to the Taj, and this can be very annoying.  Don't get me wrong, it's worth it, but it's a little confusing, and kind of annoying."
40,Tajmahal,Best glory of India,This is an historic place of India in the name of love made a beautiful Mahal with white marble and diamonds ...
30,Tajmahal,Beautiful structure but way too many people,"Visited in January 2015 and was really looking forward to it (main point of going to Agra) Went in the early afternoon. The building itself is nice and quite remarkable, but there were too many people for it to be anywhere near enjoyable - hard to take a photo without other tourists in the picture.  Queue inside is long to get in the main structure (unless you bought a foreigner ticket for more money, which we did). Once inside you were basically being pushed around the tomb with a packed crowd - couldn't really see anything or take any photos.  You also have to walk a long distance from the car/bus park (or take a rickshaw or horse drawn vehicle) to the Taj itself. Unfortunately the road itself was quite dirty and run down.  Bit of a shame to have to give this three stars, but with the experience simply wasn't too pleasant.  People will still visit for the legacy, but the grounds administrators should do something about all of the above. it's unfortunate to see something this beautiful be tarnished by other factors."
30,Tajmahal,Very good place,"Taj mahal is good place to visit. We visited in the afternoon, it was very hot. But we felt that it looks better on photos than in real."
30,Tajmahal,Whats Taj?,"Well, most of the people get carried away by talking or seeing this Taj Mahal! For me, even after 3 visits, didn't really understand, why people flock here!!! Yeah, agreed this is a huge structure. But, anything to do with love? Failed to understand THIS part. The guy married a women killing her husband, she died delivering their 10+ baby, then this guy immediately married her sister... so much for show of love, eh? Also, the research of Mr.Oak on this structure..."
30,Tajmahal,Amazing place but horrible staff and unfair prices,"The place is being renovated so it kills a bit the experience but still wonderful. Foreigner price is today 1000 rupees against 40 for locals (I understand that we have to pay more but 25 times more for a renovated Taj Mahal and a closed museum....). Plus it is said that it is going to increase again very soon. At the office (where you buy tickets in the east gate) a giant golf car is supposed to bring you to the taj but of course they told us wait 5 minutes and left the second after! (Not nice). Then we walked those 5/600 meters at 5:30 am for the sunrise and got stopped at the entrance because I had a pack of cigarette and a tripod. I know it is forbidden to smoke in there which I totally respect but they did not allow us to get in and told us to walk back this distance as the lockers are at the office!! We asked if they could keep it there and they just laughed at us (again not nice). ""We said we came for sunrise if we go back we miss it"" and they kept laughing! So we managed with a shop outside (who did not ask for money) but of course to look at their shop (which is fair ! :)). Anyway the place is gorgeous even though the tower are not properly visible and kills the tourist pictures. It still worth to go"
30,Tajmahal,Interesting but the crowd and the heat was too HIGH!!,The Marbel and the architecture was great and beatiful but the smelly sweat of 100 people inside the mahal and the 45 degree heat is not helpful.
30,Tajmahal,Romantic Hardly,"Lots of people bang on about how romantic it is to visit the Taj Mahal, I think it's passed it sell by date. The location is difficult to get to, it is suggest to be one of the 7 wonders of the world. I must commend the workers who put it together back in the 16th century. But now the place could do with some external infrastructures. You turn up at a roundabout where chaos is taking place. You are then HARASSED and I mean HARASSED by local peddlers and beggars. You then get a tuk tuk down to the main entrance which is like a building site. You then get ripped off by a tour guide, who can't even answer some of the questions. They kindly introduce you to some dodgy cameraman, who I reckon is giving them a back hander. The cameraman then takes over your entire visit and doesn't leave you alone at all.. So if there was an romance to be had, it's with a sweaty cameraman who stinks of BO.  You don't need a cameraman use your own camera or smartphone as the results are far better..!  The cameraman takes lots of pictures time and then goes for the kill..  Would you like to buy 50 60 or a 100 photos? They are RS100 each.. He then suggested I parted with RS6000 for them..! I told him where he could shove the pictures..!  This ruined our trip and quite frankly don't let them ruin yours.. I would suggest you go it alone as the guide doesn't tell you much either.."
30,Tajmahal,amazing,"A lot of people inside, the tickets were too expensive in comparation with the cost of indian people tickets, you should stay early in the morning but it was so impresive¡ It´s really one of the most beatiful places in India, you should visit."
20,Tajmahal,I guess I've seen too many pictures of it,I got up early to see the sunrise over the Taj Mahal but since it was a cloudy day it didn't make much difference when I was there. I guess it is beautiful but I wasn't very impressed. I did see a small owl in a hole in the trunk of a tree. Now that was unusual. I wouldn't travel out of my way to see it again. Many more lovely man made sights in the world.
10,Tajmahal,Hell could be a better place to visit,"The hottest, most crowded, stinky place I've been to. On top of that droves of little kids clinging to your clothes begging for money while dozens of flies make entering this place a nightmare. Honestly, I could only ask God to send a helicopter and pick me out of this beautiful architectural building that ended up in the wrongest place on earth. Sorry!"
45,Tajmahal,No Words can describe this beauty,"I thought, after seeing a lot of picture of the Taj, that it would probably be disapointing once there. How WRONG WAS I! This place exceeded my expectations, its architecture,culture,history… Agra itself is,to my opinion, the dirtiest place in India and its hard to imagining the Richness of the Taj among that city. I recommend going early on a tour and heading out the same day,as Agra has nothing much to do. Don't miss out on this World's Wonder."
45,Tajmahal,Awesome,"By looking this giant building you will recognize that why world recognize Taj mahal as a world wonder,how ever we went there during summer time,but once you attend inside of Taj Mahal you won't feel super cool,before enter to the Taj Mahal you have to wear some kind of shoes to protect marbles, any way come and enjoy n get to know why it's named as a world wonder"
45,Tajmahal,City of TAJ AGRA,"Bets time to see is early morning & from West gate , advantage is plenty of ticket issuing counter , so even in rush time , you will get the ticket quickly"
45,Tajmahal,Tour guide for Taj Mahal,Amazing experience! A Must see ! Had the best tour guide we could have asked for. Very knowledgeable about the history of Taj Mahal. Highly recommend Ajay !
45,Tajmahal,Magical place,"Taj Mahal it's magical and beautiful. It's difficult to understand the magnificent of this monument. But you need to be prepared, extreme weather conditions, dehydration and smugglers are everywhere. Make sure to book a trip in advance and always check your things."
45,Tajmahal,taj mahal,"ofcourse this place worth to visit ! beautifull and clean but too crowded as mush as other places in india if you are interested in taking alot of photos of yourself and taj mahal you can book a photographer , i did and i spent 7000 rupees , he gave me about 80 photos both in dvd and also printed and it is so good cause i never ganna come back but i have many pics of taj mahal , i also suggest you to wear saree cause it become so indian style and good for photography"
45,Tajmahal,Stunning beauty,"I am not really fan of buildings, but this beauty won my heart. From the moment we stepped in, I felt the mystery power of this creature. Guiders told us that it is a very good luck to visit Taj Mahal with your loved one. In fact, my friends who visited Taj Mahal solo, did not ""feel"" the building, they say they could not understand what is so special about it. I brought my country's flag, tried to take a photo with it, with Taj Mahal at the background. But local guide ask me not to do so, he said taking photo with other country flag was not allowed. Hmm.. okay... :) The city Agra is very clean and friendly. Would love to visit it again one day!"
45,Tajmahal,"""My Must See Bucket List Place""",This is a truly amazing sight. One of the wonders of the World. The marble looks dazzling white in the day time and changes to a rose tone at sunset. It looks like a perfectly built building with spectacular filigree details close up.
45,Tajmahal,Stunnign,"Looks amazing in real life, no picture can justify its beauty! What an amazing experience. Definitely a must see when in India for all travellers."
45,Tajmahal,Wonderful as always,"I have visited so many times, yet like to go whenever I get a chance. The building of motorway from Delhi to Agra has made a huge difference in both journey time & comfort.You can reach in two hours.The ticket fees for foreigners are much higher, but saves lot of time, if you can get a guide, but do negotiate his fees before hand to avoid trouble.Taj itself is magnificent with two graves of King Shah Jahan & his wife Mumtaz. Strangely I couldn't find a single person paying respect in the form of prayer at the grave.The gardens & pools need more attention for upkeep, although the building itself is being well looked after.The pollution levels have reduced due to ban of traffic close to it. Among its wonders is the size of verses written on the minarets, which do not show reduction in size as they go up. Really amazing piece of engineering."
45,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal on Moonlit Night,"Visited Taj on moonlight night ( Buddha poornima)..Tickets available from ASI, Agra with one day advance. Physical collection of tickets...Arranged by Manager of Taj Khema Mr. Sharma (provided you stay).. try for slots after 10:00 pm when moon is high in sky. You aallowed to see the taj fo 15 mins from the slab at the gate to taj. Group of 50 people..from 8:00 pm to 12:30 pm Mobile, bags, tripods not allowed.. only still camera and binoculars.. Not great...difficult to take snaps."
45,Tajmahal,Should visit and not just once...,Place is superb and this is my 2nd visit to same place...  People should be controlled as they throw bottle etc making this place dirty at times. Water facility should be added inside for drinking..  Don't think it is good time to visit in HOT season..
45,Tajmahal,What a sight!,It will take your breath away. The sad part is that the city itself is filthy. I hope the Indian government will clean the city so that the whole trip can be enjoyable.
45,Tajmahal,Amazing Night Tours on Full moon night,"We visited the Taj Mahal on the Full moon night of Buddha Poornima (one of the brightest full moon nights of the year, apart from Kartik Poornima etc).. It was so beautiful that it cannot be described in words..  For viewing this beauty, you need to book a separate tour called ""Taj Mahal Night View"".. These tours are available only 4 days before and after a full moon night including the full moon night, except for Fridays.. You need to do the booking in advance as there are only 400 tickets available per day.. They take people in different slots of 30min each from 8 30pm till midnight.. The midnight tour is the last one and generally the most beautiful of all.. The hotel at which you would be staying can help you book it in advance generally at an extra cost.. As of now, these tickets are not available online..  We took the midnight tour and although it was slightly cloudy when we visited, there were 3 instances of a couple of minutes each when there were no clouds at all and you could see the Taj Mahal in all its glory and including its reflection in the ponds in front..  If you have one of those fancy cameras but don't shoot at an advance level, it might be a good idea to learn all the manual settings, night mode etc of the camera.. Cell phones are not allowed for the tour so still photography is your only option.."
45,Tajmahal,Breathtaking experience,"Never seen such a wonderful place like this in my life. It was most memorable honeymoon experience for us. We stayed for 3 days in agra, and visited Taj mahal 2 times. We still cant believe how they built such a place in early days. Everyone in the world should visit Taj Mahal. Thanks for our guide, sorry i forgot his name. He spent nearly 6 hrs with us to explain each and everything about Taj Mahal."
45,Tajmahal,Awesome!,"Wow.... What an awesome place, in the true sense of the word! Since Princess Diana sat there alone, it's been a wish of mine to go there, and create a HAPPY memory . Surreal to actually be there & see the incredible architecture; the marble; the jewelled inlays. Just breathtaking , and so special to be there. An absolute ""must see""..."
45,Tajmahal,An enigmatic sensation....,"It breathes out that hypnotic air, which upon inhaling, takes the charge of your heartbeat. its a wonder of the world, my mind knew it definitely, but after having lived its peerlessly eternal perfection, whole of my soul is aware about it, aware about its nobility. i have seen it in its breathtaking golden dress,every flawless carving becoming its embroidery, the chilling waves from the yamuna, making the dress flutter, and leaving me in awe, making me sit there for hours, and take in a bit more of that enticing beauty. i have seen it in its vermilion drape, looking at the glimmering water, listening to the songs of birds and the bells of the temple. i have seen it in its shimmering gown, the full moon fulfilling the night."
45,Tajmahal,One of the world's greatest feats,"Finally being able to face the Taj Mahal-- after waking up so early, falling in line, and walking through immense gates-- is an experience that left me speechless. It's not in the magnificence of its symmetrical garden, or in the cornelian stone patterns; what makes the Taj Mahal unbelievably charming is the story echoed within its slabs of marbled walls."
45,Tajmahal,As expected,"Get there early before the crowds descend and you will appreciate the beautiful Taj before it gets too busy. We have all seen pictures of it before, but to see it in the raw is still an amazing experience.Photo opportunities abound but don't expect to get people free photos as it gets really busy as the day goes on. A truly stunning complex and if possible, visit the Baby Taj a short trip away."
45,Tajmahal,Truly a wonder,"Beautiful, the architecture is amazing, the handwork intricate, those were the true artists, them olden days"
45,Tajmahal,Just what you'd expect - if you have very high expectations!,"The Taj Mahal is everything you could expect and more. It’s bigger, more beautiful and more detailed than you could imagine. I’d recommend getting a guide to explain the details to you – surely worth the (small amount of) money."
45,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,Wonderful tour. Recommend a guide or you will miss key elements of this magnificent architectural masterpiece.
45,Tajmahal,Was on my bucket list.,"Get to the Taj early in the morning. they open at 5:30. You have to beat the crowd and the heat! It get very hard to take pictures when it is crowded. Beside the light when the sunrise is the best for those pictures. I was very disappointed to see 3 towers had the scaffolding, they said it was for cleaning the towers, no one was working there and the scaffolding being there for months. How ridiculous is that, one of the most famous site in the world. Tourists come from around the globe to see the careless Indians. In modern country this will done in 24 hours overnight without interruption to tourism. But India is true 3rd would mess, and you can spot it everywhere."
45,Tajmahal,Amazing,"What could be said that has not been said about this amazing piece of building? Just go if you have the chance. We went in May, not much tourists there so we had it to ""our self""."
45,Tajmahal,A site you'll always remember,"Visited with a colleagues, while on a business trip to India and even under such circumstances it was worth it. No matter who you go with, you will be totally overtaken by the atmosphere, the story behind it and the eye-popping beauty of the building itself. My advices: DO take a guide (make sure it's a certified one) as there is a lot to learn about it but DO NOT fall for the photographer trap; they will make you pose for the most banal and ridiculous photos. Everyone says the best time to visit is very early in the morning, so that's when we went; but that is not a must - it's splendid all day round, in haze, under bright sunlight, in the moonshine, so unless you visit several times or stay there all day, you will always miss an aspect of the Taj's beauty. It does change colour depending on the lighting, so keep your eyes wide open and just enjoy! I'd love to come back there had I the chance to."
45,Tajmahal,Awe inspiring,"Words don't describe how beautiful the story and the site of the Taj Mahal. If you get the chance, it is a must see. And get a guide, ours was a great guide and beautiful soul."
45,Tajmahal,Lovely and calm place for couples,We visited here in January 2016. It was one of the world wonders and the icon of love. Me and my wife enjoy the trip.
45,Tajmahal,Breathtaking!,"Prepare for the highlight of your India trip! Everything is simple amazing about this building"" the architecture, it's history, location - everything. It's a must see and can be combined with the Agra Fort for a day trip from Delhi. Try to get a guide, they can get you in quicker (know which gate is quick and that there is a separate queue for tourist) and will give you a good update on history, etc. They will also take you to a nearby shop (in hope of a commission) where they demonstrate to you haw the nice inlaid stones of the Taj was created. Great art, but do not feel obliged to buy. Overall, an awesome experience!"
45,Tajmahal,A small vacation,The Taj is as beautiful as ever. The scars of time and the misuse by people has taken its toll. It is still as majestic as possible. The real appreciation of its beauty can be done by sitting a bit far away from it and just feasting you eyes and allowing your mind to become tranquil. Have no words but is truly mesmerising.
45,Tajmahal,Remarkable experience,"Woke up at 5:30 am something and headed to Taj Mahal early morning. Not having a long queue. Some said it looks great and amazing during sunset. Yet, it still looks awesome during sunrise."
45,Tajmahal,Amazing!!!,"Visited there in Nov 2013 and not Nov 2015 as stated on description. Anyway, this was a truly magical experience and the most enjoyable part of India. Everything was so serene and picturesque and just like you dream about.  Happy we visited the place."
45,Tajmahal,JDV580,"Early in the morning, if you visit this TAJMAHAL,the blue sky above will smile at you with soothing sunrays,with birds to sing to greet you,in the green,before this white 350 years old mahal,when you sit and view from outside.Then as you enter,all the atmosphere will be changed, slowly and slowly.The light through the designs,curved on the stones,will make you speechless,even now.You will hear your voice,rolling on and on,all around,in a very majestic way.Through stony nets,you can see the vision outside where the blue sky with the sunrays appear very silent with hidden unspoken love,to you.You will forget that you are visiting TAJMAHAL.The white walls become very much alive there.Then at last you will come out and then photographers will be all around and they are experts indeed, to make your journey always alive,through your album.They take the money in advance and after some weeks you will receive your photos.At night TAJMAHAL is lighted and under the moonlight,spreading,all over,TAJMAHAL becomes beautiful.Do come and visit to know the depth of LOVE.This TAJMAHAL will be alive before you with regards. DIDI Jaishree Devi 2016."
45,Tajmahal,Once in a lifetime event!,You only go to Agra to see the Taj and it does not let you down. At the minute it is undergoing restoration work but that does not spoil the enjoyment. Remember it is closed on Fridays!
45,Tajmahal,Magnificent Structure,"We were privileged to be able to visit and see this magnificent structure, hear it's history and see the sun rise on it. Another off the list."
45,Tajmahal,Completely justified at being termed one of the 7 Wonders,Visited the Taj in May so it was very hot and humid but in spite of that was really impressed with the beauty and majesty of the structure. Recommend taking a government approved guide as the details of the construction of the Taj Mahal are astounding. I had read all about it but it was still astonishing to physically see the perfection of the building.
45,Tajmahal,a spiritual and solemn retreat,taking a picture of taj mahal is nothing compared to being there and feeling the atmosphere and seeing the shiny and wonderful marble of the taj... it glows at night...although a very crowded tourist area any day and high security at the gates it is a must see monument... i did not like to stay too long at the graves as i was gasping for air and the crowds were pushing inside. i pondered in my heart at this monument of love and was imagining Muslims praying there too..i sat on the bench where Lady Diana sat and hubby took a picture to fix that moment... to go there you have the option to ride on a horse sitting inside a cart as cars are not allowed to come close to the monument. It is breathtaking thanks to my Indian husband to have taken me there!
45,Tajmahal,Absolutely surreal..,"This place is right out of the pages of a great novel or travel guide. It's was all that you would expect from one of the 7 wonders in the world and then so much more. The gardens were immaculate, the entire ground was so cleaning and the crowds (immense) are manage extremely well. A must visit! and the story of Shah Jahan and his Mumtaz makes it all the more beautiful."
45,Tajmahal,Beautiful,"We visited the Taj in late April, 38+C .Dress cool & carry water. Our guide was very good ,he would repeat the story of the Taj ,he needed to as our eyes were every where, so much to take in. Photos cannot be taken inside the actual Taj , there are signs inside to remind you. For some reason locals seem able to take as many photos as they like.Beats me. Wished we could have stayed at Taj longer, it's truly amazing."
45,Tajmahal,3 girlfriend visiting northern india,Words can not express how beautiful the Taj is without seeing it with your own eyes. It is simply breathtaking and gave me chills.
45,Tajmahal,Architectural wonder!,"The symbol of love-a well earned title to this majestic and beautiful tomb. Very well maintained, it has a separate queue (and entry fee list) for Indians and foreigners. Superb maintanence has been ensured and that's the reason you have to stop all vehicles about 2 kilometres away from the entrance. Cycle rickshaws have been arranged by the locals......they charge a nominal fee right upto the main gate."
40,Tajmahal,amazing!,"The Taj Mahal is a must see historically, architecturally artistically and culturally breathtaking!!"
40,Tajmahal,Truly the jewel of India,"This is one of a number of reviews that I will be writing following our recent trip through northern India. My family and I (wife and 10 year old daughter) recently went on an Intrepid Tour through Northern india to catch the key sites. This is our adventure there.  What can I say that hasn't already been said. The Taj Mahal is one of the most recognised places in the world. Everything will have been said before, so I'll give you my impressions, and you can take them or leave them.  Like everything in India (and many other countries with history that goes back thousands of years) the Taj Mahal is another grimy dirty monument surrounded by piles of rubbish in the middle of a desert. It sits in the middle of a river bend on the site of an old palace that was demolished to make way for it. Even grimy, it is still spectacular, and the sun at dawn glints off the facade like looking at a thousand diamonds in a waterfall. And, it's not all bad news. Massive restorations are underway, and three of the four corner towers were being cleaned when we were there.  Like all Indian monuments, you walk up an elephant sized walkway to massive gates, and then as you walk through the gates, the vista towards the Taj opens up before you. Morning is the best time (it seems) as you catch the morning sun on the marble. Later in the day, the marble can be very hot, and you cannot walk around the main structure in shoes (so you take them off and go barefoot or in socks, or you put the provided foot coverings). over your shoes, which can be pretty slippy on the polished surfaces.  The pathways to the main monument take you past a series of waterways, but none of them were running. even though most of the tourists arrive at dawn, the fountains only run a certain times of the day, and we couldn't work out when that was. You get your best photos from the main gatehouse into the site, or from a platform located in the dead centre of the gardens.  You walk into the main building up some fairly steep stairs (so watch your step), and then follow the signs into the main chamber. No photos allowed. Mahal is interred in the centre of the chamber, with Jahan beside her (which throws off the symmetry of the room, but is still very striking. Make no mistake, the inside of the main chamber is stark, and echoing, and rather dull - the externals are what is spectacular.  Spend some time in the gardens, and explore all the surrounding buildings as well. The Taj has two huge side buildings that were constructed to artificially frame the Taj, and to draw your eye towards the Taj itself. Both of these buildings, and the entire courtyard surrounding structures are well worth spending time exploring.  Lastly, if you are visiting the Taj Mahal before dawn, you will have to stand in the entrance queue. It is very hot later in the day, but before dawn it is relatively cool, so the mosquitoes are all out partying. bring insect repellant (which is one of the very few liquids that are permitted through the security checkpoint into the complex) and bring lots of it. You will need to spray all over including your hair.  Enjoy!"
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful!,Totally worth visiting. Try to see it from different angles and times of the day as this beautiful building seems to be constantly changing.
40,Tajmahal,awesome place.. a must visit,it was an amazing and unbelievable experience. visiting it with my family for the first time was terrific...
40,Tajmahal,Its a Wonder of the World,"How can you review one of the 7 Wonders of the World, really? It was an experience that had me both in awe and feeling humble. What I can give you is some advice; go early, tickets for non Indian nationals must be bought at a separate window where you will be approached by an official guide (do it!), you jump all the queues, get your own personal photographer for those iconic backdrops and of course you learn all the history and interesting facts. After your guide will take you to a store were they demonstrate marble work, which is interesting, souvenirs here are expensive though in comparison to what you can buy in Delhi (Jan Path Market for example), so unless there is something totally original, I don't think its worth it. Now the Taj is ticked off my list; one time visit is more the enough for me :)"
40,Tajmahal,Incredible India,"Truly it can stand as one of the 7 wonders of the modern world. Beautiful site, monument. I loved every minute from the moment I stepped in the gates. Everyone traveling to India should arrange a visit to Agra. I advise planning a weekday visit as in India monuments and temples on weekends are very crowded. There is a priority lane for foreigners, which is logical since we pay a ticket which is much more expensive than locals do (like 100X)"
40,Tajmahal,Simply Amazing,Amazing! The scenery and building materials are just amazing but it's always crowded be it during boiling hot summer or during cold winter :D You will find plenty of things to enjoy outside this Taj too.
40,Tajmahal,Wah,I visited Taj twice. In 2005 and in 2015. I am not going to say a word about the monument. Its incredible!!! Almost a gap of a decade in my 2 visits. Huge change in surroundings. Infrastructure around has be developed a lot but yes crowd as well. Lack of proper guidance and cheating all around. There should be more planning in terms of people entry as per time slot so that everyone can enjoys this incredible monument with peace.
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal- the monument of love,"Visited at the time of sunrise and it was a marvelous view. the Taj takes four colours in a day. Pink, White, Grey & Purple. Visiting taj is a lifetime experience."
40,Tajmahal,The greatest monument in the world.,"Out of this world. No pictures or review can ever escapsulate this awesome and magnificent place, just go there and see and feel for yourself."
40,Tajmahal,Ofcourse it's the Taj Mahal,So u have to be prepared with the story before u come face to face with Taj Mahal... and once ur guide finish the story... u walk at the central line before entering the gates... and u slowly see the stunning taj mahal appearing from the opening in front of u... u continue walking.. and here it is... as stunning as it gets... i was only frustrated bcz 3 of the 4 Minarets were having constructions over them.. the guide told us they were being cleaned.. it is worth it... worth the 1000 rupee and more..
40,Tajmahal,Beauty,The Real Beauty can't be explained by words.  One of among the world's most beautiful places.
40,Tajmahal,Should be in your bucket list!!!,"Its amazing, what you see in the pictures is not the same as when you see it with your own eyes….. Prefect harmony everywhere...you truly can feel and see the power of love…… Make sure you have a guided tour if you want to learn the history behind it other wise is another mausoleum …. you need a tour guid…."
40,Tajmahal,Quite simply amazing - better than you expect too!,"Fabulous! The marble is amazing and in great condition considering the age - all very worthwhile, despite the heat and large number of people."
40,Tajmahal,"More than any picture can capture, you just have to see it for yourself","What can I say. It is more beautiful than any picture can capture, you just have to see it for yourself. A love story that brings a tear to my eye and a sadness in my heart. A structure unlike any other in the world and remarkably maintained. Words really can’t do it justice. After an hour of so with a tour guide we spent another hour plus just wandering around the TM and it’s surroundings. It is one the most, if not the most beautiful structure I have ever seen. I can’t imagine anyone coming to India and not taking the Taj Mahal the top of their must see list. We were there at the end of March and it was starting to get a bit warm. We were there early in the morning but there are plenty of trees to provide shade on the grounds but it was quite hot in the sun."
40,Tajmahal,In Love with Love symbol....,It is so beautifully crafted in Marble. Should observe the craftmenship of ancient culture. Friday closed. For Indian citizen entry is Rs. 40/- and for Foreign nationals Rs. 1000/-. It is open from Sunrise to Sunset so according to our convenience we can travel. Must see place in India
40,Tajmahal,Worthy of being a Wonder of The World,"If your staying at the Oberoi they take care of the tickets Transport (both are free from the Oberoi) and use of a local guide (very well priced) I arrived at 05:30 as there was no queues went straight in, not much can be said about the Taj that hasn't already been said its a fantastic place and should be seen at least in a lifetime."
40,Tajmahal,7th visit and still beautiful :),"Taj Mahal needs no introduction and though it personally my 7th visit I still loved it.  Summer time is low season given the hot weather 43-46 degree Celsius!! But this also means shorter queues and less crowds.  I would recommend hiring a guide (costs approx 500 rupees ) and hire a instant photographer to take few pictures on he royal seat and around taj.  So carry an ID, water, sunglasses. Note that no food item is allowed inside taj compound and it is advisable to leave valuables at hotel locker."
40,Tajmahal,Incredible is not enough!!!!,Its a must visit for any person in his lifetime. Mesmerised with its structure. You cant stop clicking pics. I took a guide who explained something which is already available on net. Avoid guide.
40,Tajmahal,Mesmerizing monument,"Finest craftmanship and architecture is what Taj Mahal is all about. Its close on Friday, that was one important information, we forgot to carry and had to wait for 1day before visiting Taj Mahal!"
40,Tajmahal,Stunning,"Get there for sunrise, you won't regret it. They don't allow backpacks in. Watch sunset fr across the river."
40,Tajmahal,The fulfilment of a dream.,"Visited this on my birthday and it was the fulfilment of a dream I have had for many years, and I was not disappointed."
40,Tajmahal,Simply Stunning,"This monument was simply stunning. The marble work and details are really truly one of a kind. I believe everyone must see this place at least once in their life. However, be prepared for lots of lines, pushy people and tourists taking pictures. We arrived at 530 am to be there for sunrise and there were tons of people already lined up. There is a separate line for foreigners to purchase tickets. There will be many people outside claiming to be tour guides for an extra fee (You don't need them, and many are scams). The fee in March was 750 rupees, but I heard from a friend as of April it was doubled. With your ticket you should receive a bottle of water and shoe covers. Then be aware there is a separate line for men and women to go inside. To help speed the process along try to not bring a bag because then you have to have it checked by security and this can take awhile, esp for the ladies. Once inside take time to enjoy the taj and other surrounding buildings and gardens. There is a museum but that does not open until 9 am."
40,Tajmahal,No Picture Can Do It Justice,"Just a few observations to add to the many already recorded here and elsewhere: 1. The minarets have scaffolding around them. Having seen the Taj without the scaffolding I don't think it significantly detracts from the experience. 2. The audio guides are quite good and well worth the 120 Rs price 3. I read this elsewhere and highly recommend doing the following. Get there at 5 am or so, get your ticket and get in line. Once you are admitted, head straight for the dome before anyone else arrives and stand there to hear ""the sound of the dome."" It is an ethereal mix of wind and other sounds that is indescribable. Once others come in and start talking, it's hard, if not impossible to catch that sound again. After you've spent some time in the dome head back to the entrance, get your audio guides and take your other pictures."
40,Tajmahal,Beauty calling again and again,The beautify Taj is awesome. It might be one I visited more than five times. Amazing architecture and with perfect white marbles.
40,Tajmahal,Amazing,This was one of the main reason we visited India and we were so delighted to see the Taj Mahal. We loved this place a lot!
40,Tajmahal,Truly wonder!,"The best destination when you are in India! Just be careful for pickpockets, we got some unpleasant experience when the guide forced us to stores we didn't wanna go :( I know they need commission but come on..., we already said we don't want to"
40,Tajmahal,A taj of Love,This is truly the world's largest monument to love. It actually took my breath away! we got great pictures!
40,Tajmahal,Seven wonders is awesome,"Well speechless for this monumental and memorial visit, we stayed in Raddison blue and the view from there was mind boggling. A must visit place in a lifetime"
40,Tajmahal,It was Just Beautiful,It was great to visit. Best time to go is when the sun raises. its not crowded. you just a very beautiful place to visit. the guide we had was very good and explain how taj mahal came out.
40,Tajmahal,Gorgeous,"The Taj Mahal was absolutely amazing. We went to the west gate entrance, we were told to stay away from there because it's busy but it's the only entrance that has a place to put you bags because your bags aren't allowed in. It's easier to go to the west gate. When we got off the train we walked outside and when you look out to the right a little you'll see the pre paid taxi service. GO THERE so you don't get ripped off. It's run by the Agra police so you don't get hassled. You tell them what entrance you want to go to and then you pay and get your ride there. Don't talk to anyone else because you will literally get bombarded with people asking you if you want a ride. Just walk straight to the pre paid booth.  When you're walking around the Taj Mahal keep everything in your front pockets and put your hands in your pockets when you're walking around. People will walk by and cut your pockets so everything falls out. Keep a close eye on your belongings this is the top spot for pick pockets."
40,Tajmahal,Mesmerising visit to taj after a long time with my son,It was simply wonderful and rekindling memories of earlier visits to Taj Mahal This time it was very special since visiting with my wife and son for the first time Great effort being undertaken to maintain the building Was much cleaner and better managed than earlier visits Tourists are now more aware and take very good care of the premises It's great to know that it will still be standing for our future generations to come
40,Tajmahal,WOW!,This was the main reason we visited India and we weren't disappointed. Best time to visit is sunrise - no crowds and the sun glistens on the crystals in the marble.
40,Tajmahal,Absolutely lived up to the hype!,"A true marvel. The work that went into building this at the time it was built is amazing. Unlike a lot of places you see pictures of and then see in real life and feel disappointed, the Taj Mahal truly lived up to the hype. Recommend going early in the morning before the crowds develop. You can also go to a park on the other side of the river and see the back aspect as well. Not sure if it is true but we were told it is open at night on the full moon to see the inlaid Star of India stones reflecting the moon.  Highly recommend having a guide to get you through the lines entering and to tell you the history of the complex. Very inexpensive to do.  CLOSED ON FRIDAYS!!"
40,Tajmahal,Amazing,"Words can't describe the beauty of this enormous wonder. Seeing it in textbooks, online or on tv you think, hmm looks cool. To actually see it in person is something totally different. It actually took my breath away. I just stood there in awe of what I was actually seeing. To think this structure is actually a shrine to the king's late wife, was designed and built on the banks of the Yamuna River in the 1600s by 20,000 workers and took over 20 years to complete. Without modern technology, they were able to make working fountains, achieve perfect symetry, use optical illusions and move very heavy marble rocks. This in-of itself is amazing."
40,Tajmahal,DO IT!,"This was one stop of many while experiencing Amazing Incredible India. The story of the Taj is a magnificent as the structure. This is truly the world's largest monument to love. The only unfortunate part of visiting the Taj is access, which is down a small street littered with dung. But that's India.  Remember to visit the various ""factories"" that abut the Taj. There is one that I remember barely a block away where the artisans make tables, beds and much more using the same techniques handed down to them from their fathers over the years.  Another ""must see"" is the Red Fort within view of the Taj. It is from there that you learn much about the Taj, and it's significance in India's history. Across the river behind the Taj is the land that was set aside by a Maharajah for his own tomb (never built).  Do not rush this site. Take your time. Figure on a few hours at best. It will stay with you for the rest of your life."
40,Tajmahal,Wonderful!!,"A marvel of architecture and handicraft. Each detail is made very carefully. Either it is made of red stones or made of marble, you can enjoy every sculpture and every decoration. A monument made in a perfect symmetry. However, the visitor has to continously fight in order to avoid being continuously disturbed by photographers, guides, and sellers. I have nothing against these people but I don't like the way they are doing and insisting. At the end, they sell you things that you don't need with high prices. We always have a to heavily negotiate the prices."
40,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,"This place is really breathtaking, one must go to see it at least once in lifetime, great architecture with amazing art work , I don't understand how come people are giving 2 or 3 stars to this wonder"
40,Tajmahal,Speechless!!,"The Taj Mahal was amazing.... Yes, there will be crowds and it will be hot but that is something you must be prepared for. Also note, there is quite a long walk from the entrance to the actual Taj Mahal. We opted for a photographer but it was a bit overwhelming as I was so excited to see the Taj Mahal and then I had the photographer being quite pushy and rushed (stand here, put your arms up, down, sit, come over here). Granted we got great pictures but in retrospect I would have preferred to have done the tour first then have taken the pictures. Regardless, this is a must see!!! Absolutely breathtaking!!"
40,Tajmahal,Soulful,Taj Mahal is one the most beautiful historical monument in India. It's history is so rich that you would love to read it again and again.
30,Tajmahal,Fantastic,"A beautiful and iconic building which needs to be visited. Visited in time for the sun rising in order to see the main building turn from light pink to bright white. Wandered around the grounds and inside the mausoleum, it's a very humbling experience and extremely beautiful."
30,Tajmahal,!!!!,"This is our 4th wonder of the world now seen! Well what can I say that hasn't been said about this magnificent wonder of the world already! Been wanting to tick this off the bucket list for a few years and my husband finally agreed to accompany me - even he had to agreed it is just stunning and mind blowing when your guide informs you of the history and the work that went into building it - bearing in mind this was all back in the 1600s! The detailed carving, inlaid gemstones and lattice work is marvellous! (I even spotted a vulture atop one of the columns).... And of course, there is then the poignant love story behind this beautiful work of art......Go at sunrise and then sunset across the river to get different perspectives of this work of art."
30,Tajmahal,Simply amazing,"It looks so small from afar and as you get closed, you realize the amount of work it took to create this wonder. My tour organizer had suggested visiting a marble place before and it was worth it...we could really appreciate the work that has been put into all of it..."
30,Tajmahal,Mesmerizing,Left for Taj on a Sunday afternoon from Delhi. Firstly the drive on the express way was amazing. Reached around 5 in a very pleasant evening. Everything about Taj is awesome. Me and my family had a great time admiring every structure and all the awesome views around. Once in a lifetime experience.
30,Tajmahal,Stunning,I never in my wildest dreams thought I would ever visit this wonder of the world. It really is beautiful but get there at sunrise to beat the crowds and get a guide as he will show you secret little photo spots. Go with the bare essentials to cut down on security checks - all you need is your camera and money - anything else will just get in the way and stop you appreciating the site in all its glory. Don't be rushed around - just drink in the atmosphere.
30,Tajmahal,Stunning.,"We travelled to Agra using a private tour company. Our drive from Delhi took us 4 hours using the new express route. Agra was very busy as it was a day of celebration when we visited. The downside of the visit was we had a wait of 1 1/2 hours to enter the mausoleum . It was 42degrees so not a pleasant wait, on top of this people were constantly queue jumping. High security present."
30,Tajmahal,Mesmerised....,"Ultimate, mind blowing.. How one can define this beautiful monument.. It's The Taj Mahal.. This is my fourth visit of Taj and yet again I am speechless.. My little son also fall in love with it. He asked me many questions abt it. Waiting to visit again.."
30,Tajmahal,Amazing.,"It's even better in person. I've always looked at it in photos, but seeing it personally just blew me away. Be sure to avoid going the summer as the temperatures can be very hot. Beautiful place to see the sunrise."
30,Tajmahal,Sublime admiration.,"Whatever you hear about india, Taj Mahal is one of the first things it always come to our minds... it is admired by locals and internationals. It belongs to the world and if you are lucky enough to go there, you really need to take your time to feel how that beauty gives its enchantment to all."
30,Tajmahal,great monument with e great story,we were earlier visiting this monument without a guide but at last moment we hired Nand who told us all the stories of the taj and i will personally say that having a guide is a must at the tajmahl
30,Tajmahal,Simply mesmerising,Went to the Taj twice...bought tickets online so no queues.. Best to see in the morning glory with sun rise...see it to believe.. Clean and lovely...except arrogant Cisf jawans every thing else the best
30,Tajmahal,Incredible,The first time i visited the taj mahal was amazing . good experience lot of tourist visit . amazing view from far .
30,Tajmahal,Amazing Place,"Taj Mahal is a palace to see. You should go there early in the morning - we entered at 6 AM. It is not yet too hot and it is not yet to crowded and Morning Sun ""light"" makes miracle with Taj. Inside there are very interesting thinks made by marble and some special stones brought from different places"
30,Tajmahal,Monument of Love,A visit worth to see this beautiful monument. Need to go as early as possible to avoid the crowd. The lesser the people the better the photo taking opportunity. it will be also good to go during sun rise or sun set as the taj mahal glows with different reflection of the sun and moon light. Also visit the back of the taj mahal which has barren land that was supposed to hold the black Taj Mahal for Shah jahan himself. That never happened as his son imprisoned him.
30,Tajmahal,The TAJ,"You will hate every second of the time you are trying to get to the Taj...the traffic just outside the site, shady crowd, filth all around...but one look at the majestic structure, and all your frustration evaporates! You will fall in love with the structure and understand what all the hype is about. So trust me, the struggle is worth it ;)"
30,Tajmahal,Wah Taj,"What can one say about that Taj that hasn't been said already. This monument is best experienced. It is massive,beautiful and makes you wonder how such fine worksmanship got done so many centuries ago.  This place is called one of the wonders of the world for good reason!"
30,Tajmahal,Exceptional,"One of the most beautiful places in India, what a place what an architecture! It was amazing visit. Don't miss the chance to visit this magnificent place."
30,Tajmahal,Wah Taj,it was a dream come true after a long planned out visit to taj. The day we went the crowds were lesser and it all made the day
30,Tajmahal,Fantastic,"Awesome place , epitome of excellence.. Must visit...looks fantastic at night ...art at its best ..really enjoyed."
30,Tajmahal,Roamwithom Taj Daytrip,Roamwithom Taraji breezy trip to the Taj. Best private tour ever. ! The golf cart from our hotel the Amarvillas slips you in without all the hassle from the street. Easy Peasy. Mellow out on a bench. Close your eyes for peek into ancient times. The trees are lovely to sit under. Gaze out on a wonder of the earth.
30,Tajmahal,Romantic,"Excellent car, driver, and guide. This is an excellent way to see the Taj Mahal and Fort in a one day excursion from Delhi. Our guide was terrific, and was fine when we politely informed him we had no interest in purchasing a rug or any other craft item in Agra. Be prepared for horrendous traffic on your re-entry to Delhi, but, that's Delhi!"
30,Tajmahal,Was not prepared for how stunning this is!,"I was really excited to see this, but having spent a few days in Delhi and seeing some beautiful temples etc, my first glimpses of the Taj Mahal left me slightly disappointed. But when we got there and walked through - wow. It's stunning. So serene despite being heaving.  As westerners we were hounded by locals for photos which was a bit annoying. We agreed to begin with but then had to say no as it got silly.  We had an excellent guide which I'm sure helped, and we enjoyed seeing the monkeys.  Shame 3 of the towers had scaffolding up and that you could not take pictures inside.  Everyone should visit here."
30,Tajmahal,Amazing building comes with expected hustle,"As many other reviews have said, this is an amazing building. Truly remarkable craftsmanship. 3 minarets are still in scaffolding for cleaning but this didn't detract at all and is necessary. It can be easy to feel quite rushed here as people jostle for the best photography view points and the guards try to rush you though the mausoleum. I had a guide (booked though hotel with a driver) who helped to avoid queues, he was closely linked with photographers, marble sellers etc and you do get the full on sales pitch. I asked him for 10 minutes alone so I could take time to absorb the experience. I was driven (5mins) to a marble market which was beautiful but not something I wanted to buy. Just need to be firm although towards the end of the trip when he did realise I genuinely wouldn't be buying anything, his attitude changed a little! What I didn't expect was the camels and monkeys around the outside which add to the theatre of the visit. A definite must when you are in the area and the new express way meant we drone from New Delhi to Agra in less than 2 hours (Early Sunday morning so light traffic also). Closed on Fridays as a religious day. (Guide said many people are left disappointed by this)."
30,Tajmahal,As amazing as expected,"Visiting here was like a dream!! It is as spectacular, if not more spectacular, than expected even the big crowds didnt bother me. Tourists pay more than Indian visitors but they get a free bottle of water and shoe covers which you need to go inside the Taj. Definitely worth a visit if possible.  Also grab views of the Taj at sunset for free by going across the river."
50,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal visit,Our Taj Mahal visit in May month while it was 49 degree in Agra was so cool. Just a walking distance from Taj Inn hotel where we stayed. We could take a large number of good photos in Taj Mahal.
50,Tajmahal,A Man-made marvel! The Taj,"The Taj Mahal is an amazing Wonder of the man-made World. The first view of this majestic monument captures your excitement and you go ""Wow!"". You will get amazed by its size and beauty. You can access the Taj Mahal from the East gate from 6:00 am to 5.30 pm. The tickets are available at the UP Tourism department counter at Shilpagram complex about 1/2 km before the east gate. Considering the tourist potential of this place, the government has renovated the east gate entrance and it is quite neat and spacious with good pavements and lighting. There are cycle rickshaws available to travel the distance if you are lazy to walk. Also the dept runs Electric buses for drop at the Taj entrance after 8.00 am. To avoid the crowd and escape the bright sunshine, you can visit Taj in the morning at 6.30 am and peacefully enjoy the view from all directions. The reflection of the morning sun on the Marble gives a yellow glow when you watch from the east side. The Yamuna river flows on the back side of the Taj and you can also see the Agra fort in the distance. You should not miss the view of the Taj from the other bank of Yamuna, the Mehtab Garden. Take time out in the evening and be at Mehtab garden before sunset to see the sunset view of the Taj from a distance. Its an amazing sight and one can keep recollecting that Image for a long time to come. Amazing man-made Wonder - The Taj Mahal."
50,Tajmahal,Marvellous,Taj is always a fascination for everyone. when I visited the minarets of Taj were going through the maintenance which was a bit of disappointment however the overall experience has been great.
50,Tajmahal,I couldn't believe I was there,"I've been waiting years to be able to see it with my eyes and finally I was there, and couldn't believe it. It's a marvallous place that you cannot miss it.... although there is too many people doing the same so it is really crowded.  When you arrive at the parking zone, you can choose to go walking, take the big bus used mainly by locals for just a coin, or the electric train that is usually used by foreign tourists. Then you arrive at the security gate, where you must show your bags and make a queu and cross a security arch (one queu for men and another for women) as if you where in the airport. And after a little walk, you are in front of the Royal Gate: the four storeyed main gateway of the Taj Mahal, which is 100 feet high and is built in red sandstone.  Before crossing it, you can guess the silhouette of the Taj Mahal at the horizon, looking through the door.... but after crossing the door the experience is indescribable: you are finally in front of one of the best wonders in the world.  If you are patient, you can achieve to get a good picture in front of it.  Please, take your time to walk around the gardens and admire the building from all the corners: the best !!!  You can also get into the Taj Mahal. You don't have to take your shoes as it is not a temple, but a burial place. You just have to cover your shoes (the guides usually provide a cover for the shoes).  Don't forget to admire the walls inlaid with precious stones that cover all the building.  I wish I can return to this magic place !!!!"
50,Tajmahal,Any recommendations for taj mahal,"1. Dont carry a big bag, its not allowed. Only small pieces. If you have a bag you have to go to locker room and its complicated. 2. Fee: 1000Rs for foreigns 3. The best option is arrive at 5:30am, no people and you can see sunrise (good moment). Only west gate is open early."
50,Tajmahal,Get there early!,"I always knew this would be a special place, but wasn't expecting it to blow me away the way it did. We got there at 5:30, when the park opened. The ticket line was nonexistent, so that was quick.Don't forget your bottle of water and shoe covers before you leave the office. You will definitely want the water and need the shoe covers (or go barefoot) to enter the building. We entered from the East Gate and had a rickshaw driver take us from the ticket office to the gate. There are battery-operated carts that take you from the ticket office to the entry, but they ran really sporadically, from what we could tell. Prior to entering the grounds, there is a security check. Note that no camera tripods are allowed. We had a small travel-sized one in the camera bag that we'd forgotten was there, and my husband had to exit the secure area to store it and then go through security again, which was kind of a pain. Crowds were small enough at that time of day to allow us to get some beautiful photos without people in them. The building is truly stunning and I highly recommend a trip over to Agra Fort when you are done. We did both and were back to our hotel just as the tour buses were loading up to take people out there in the heat of the day - ugh."
50,Tajmahal,Excellebt,"Beautiful wonder if the world and excellent, knowledgable guide. Well worth going at sunrise, 5:30am, to avoid crowds and amazing sunlight!"
50,Tajmahal,No words.,"No words can truly describe this place. It's beauty and it's magic are only understood when you're actually there, in the moment.  Pictures and videos don't do it justice.  Beware of the touts and be well prepared for the hassle of being harassed by hawkers.  You will be lucky if you don't get ripped off but it is worth the visit."
50,Tajmahal,Magificent,"This is one place on our bucket list. Taj Mahal located in Agra which is about a 4.5 hour drive from Delhi. We stayed at the Oberoi Amarvilas located very close to the Taj Mahal. The hotel provides golf cart transport to/from Taj Mahal. We visited at around 6am to avoid the crowds and hot sun. Bring bottled water to keep hydrated. There is a security check point prior to entering the site. Among restricted items are cigarette lighters, matches, sharp objects including pencils. Anything that can be used to deface or harm the structure is not allowed. Photos are allowed outside the Taj Mahal. No photos inside and shoe covers (buy as you enter) are required. The structure itself is magnificent. The gardens and reflecting pools are awesome. The entire site is an architectural masterpiece."
50,Tajmahal,"You know what, it cannot be over-hyped","It's that fabulous. Sure there are crowds, but the building and the mosaic decorative elements, and basically everything is great. We went early morning and early evening (for the best light, and to avoid the heat). Well worth it. (For a tip: watch the aggressive vendors on the way in.)"
50,Tajmahal,World wonder,This is a most beautiful place in India and it is also one of world wonder nice architecture complete marble with carvings
50,Tajmahal,Beautiful,You obviously don't need a review to convince you to come here but if you're trying to save a few dollars then the Delhi tourism board do day trips from Delhi to Agra with a tour guide covering the the taj and Agra fort. Pretty great value for money and much cheap than private tours
50,Tajmahal,Symbol of love,Agra Taj Mahal architecture is one of the best in our country truly deserves to be among 7 wonders of the world.try visiting during morning or evening time because during morning it gives white look and during evening time it gives yellow look.it is symbol of love..
50,Tajmahal,A place you have to go once in your life,"I have been there twice and never get tired to visit this wonderful monument. Every hour of the day is different, you can see it during the sunshine and sunset and it worths anyway!"
50,Tajmahal,Arrive early for the sunrise experience,"Try to arrive at the gates well before the opening time of 6.15am. Getting inside the grounds requires security screening, which can be a little slow. Just take a camera, any bags will slow you down. I suggest waiting at the internal main gate with the Taj Mahal in full view and just soaking up the experience of the white marble changing colour as the sun rises. I have read many accounts of this colour change, it really has to be seen first hand. There is scaffolding on 3 of the minarets while cleaning is underway. This is the price of a pristine attraction."
50,Tajmahal,Stunning,"Beautiful, it speaks for it's self really. Only negative is the ugly scaffolding that is currently up! 1000rp for entry make sure you have some change for a locker as no backpacks are allowed in. I went at sunrise and it was really good because I bet the crowd! Beware of scammers!"
50,Tajmahal,Lovely place,Agra Taj Mahal architecture is one of the best in our country.Try visiting during morning or evening time because during morning it gives white look and during evening time it gives yellow look.Marbel is also not very hot during that time. I would suggest you to have one guide with you who can explain the details of each place otherwise you will miss the significance of various things.
50,Tajmahal,OUTSTANDING,"The ""Tajmahal""truly deserves to be among the 7 wonders of the world.This ""monument of love""is simply breath taking and really a sight to behold.This structure is magnificent in every way.When visiting Delhi don't miss the chance of seeing this splendid piece of art."
50,Tajmahal,My childhood dream come true,"What more can I say than what has been said by many? A beautiful monument and I suggest visiting it at sunrise when it’s cooler and there are a lot less tourists. This stunning visit to the TM was made all the more memorable with a guide and driver from City Linkers. It was a quick trip on my way back from Australia and I was welcomed at the airport in Delhi by the driver and manager who had concocted a great private itinerary to Agra. They booked everything from hotel, visits, guide to driver which I’d paid earlier (very competetive) so there was no surprise on payment on arrival and no queuing for tickets. Both guide and driver were very courteous and very informative. I strongly advise a guide as they’re able to keep peddlars at a distance, the driver ensures a safe pick up and drop off at the airport (he stays with you throughout your stay)."
50,Tajmahal,Dream of lovestory (shahjahan),Taj Mahal is dream of all in coming tourist of agra. and any foreigner tourist never want miss this building. with tour guide great experience about taj mahal. mostly sun rise and sun set time is better for taj mahal. after 2 hrs visit we pass trans yamuna. here Mehtab bagh. great photography of taj mahal from this point.here totally white marble used in taj mahal.
50,Tajmahal,One Of The Best Wonders Of World,I have been lot of Amazing places in India but Taj Is The Best One.there is none that compares to this one .Taj is very interesting monument Such an awesome piece of history.Magnificent marble palace. We had a good guide with us which made the walk more exciting.I would definitely recommend TAJ
50,Tajmahal,India wouldn't be India without the Taj Mahal,Feel stupid for writing this review because it's a must see when visiting India. It is magnificently opulent but also beautifully serene. Loved my time there.
50,Tajmahal,More beautiful than I'd imagined,"Sometimes when I travel, I just figure I'll bag a place when I'm in the area. And the place stuns me. Makes my jaw drop, sends goosebumps down my spine, and makes my eyes well up. The Taj Majal did this to me.  Mind you, we arrived before sunrise, so it was peaceful and uncrowded. But the size, symmetry, antiquity, and details really struck something inside me that I hadn't expected."
50,Tajmahal,Awesome Day,Luckily I went the day when they open the Tomb at the Taj Mahal which happens once in a year and the guide was really friendly and it was good experience.
50,Tajmahal,A vision in marble !,"The Taj is everything it is reputed to be - and more. Ethereally beautiful, it is truly a poem carved in stone. We had gone early in the morning (had booked the tickets online), to beat the heat and the hordes. We were impressed with the arrangements and upkeep of the place. We hired a guide and a professional photographer there- wise decision. Both were very good. Shoe covers and water bottles were being sold near the entrance-so,no problems. The Taj is truly magnificent. One was lost in awe gazing at the building and the beautiful pieta dura work and the marble work. Exquisite. We had also booked a hotel package so as to get the tickets to view the Taj on a full moon night (these tickets are sold only on the previous day and Not booked online ). Security is tight and they only allow you to go till the sandstone platform and view the Taj from a distance. Anyway, it still looked calm and serene and beautiful in the moonlight. Glad we were able to go !"
50,Tajmahal,Inspirational,"I'm not really sure what to expect before visiting the Taj Mahal. It was definitely something we thought we should go to visit whilst in India, but I wasn't prepared for the actual feeling I experienced when setting my eyes on the Taj through the entrance gates. It genuinely was awe inspiring and something I will never forget. We timed things very well, travelling from Delhi on the 6am train, allowing us to arrive at the Taj by 8:30. No queues and plenty of opportunity to grab uninterrupted photographs. A clear wonder of the World."
50,Tajmahal,Grandeur!!!,Needless to mention it is 7 wonder and a must visit if you are in Agra/India.Built from makrana marbles it's a marvel. Beautiful to see in moonlight .
50,Tajmahal,Superlatives don't do it justice - A Must See,"Like almost every World Traveler - The Taj Mahal was at the very top of our Must See list. Words cannot describe how magnificent this place is, so I won't try. I will however offer some practical advice. Firstly, try to pre-organise a guide, we visited with a private guide and would have missed an awful lot without him. Get there very early, we got picked up at our hotel at 06:15 hrs and didn't actually get in until 07:30 hrs. Our guide had to queue for our tickets, which included a bottle of water and shoe covers. There's then a 1km walk or, as we did, jump into one of the free electric mini buses to the entrance. Once at the entrance we had to queue for security, WOMEN and MEN must queue separately. At security, there's an electronic scan, body and bag search. Note we saw Tripods, even mini tripods being confiscated, they're not allowed inside so you have to deposit them and collect them later. This can present a problem if entering the East Gate and leaving by the West Gate, the ideal route. Our guide advised us the night before not to bring any bags for a number of reasons, getting through security being the main one. All we brought were cameras and wallet. Just enjoy the whole magnificence of the place."
50,Tajmahal,A beautiful place on earth,I have no words to tell about this beautiful monument. I got stunned by its beauty... Surroundings was also good... the garden and mosque was quiet admirable..
50,Tajmahal,The long drive to a Timeless Beauty was worthwhile,"I and my friends arrived at the Taj Mahal complex at Sunrise (5:30 AM) on a Saturday in April 2016. Along with our tour guide, we rode (for at least 5 minutes) a rickshaw from the main street to the Taj Mahal main gate. On our way out, we had the chance to ride a horse carriage (for at least 5 minutes). Upon seeing the Taj Mahal from the main entrance, I can’t help but be amazed at its beauty and it becomes more impressive as I got closer. Despite the distance from the main entrance and the hot weather, I really enjoyed the walk to the building as I was totally mesmerized by the view. The highlight is witnessing the intricacy of the Taj Mahal’s wall arts which is absolutely breathtaking!! My Taj Mahal experience is priceless and the long drive from Delhi to Agra was all worthy!! Reminders or Suggestions: (a) Taj Mahal is closed on Fridays; (b) Best time to visit at Sunrise time (early morning) to avoid crowds and will have nice photo ops; (c) Entrance Fee of INR 1,000 per person. Try to avoid summer peak season as it will be scorching; (d) No dress code; (e) Some items (e.g. head phones, mobile chargers, tripods, food) are not allowed inside the complex but mobile phones and selfie sticks are allowed; and (f) It requires at least 1.5 or 2 hours to really enjoy the place and take photos. I also recommend for visitors to ask one of the photographers on site to take your photos as they know the best spot to take photos. I found the price to be reasonable for photos worth keeping. Caution should always be taken in dealing or negotiating with the photographers."
50,Tajmahal,Must see once a life,Taj Mahal has a reason to rule the award as one of the most iconic monument of the world.Together with the records and stories belong to TM - very few other site exist on the Globe.Visit in the early morning time to avoid the crowd. Pity that some precious stones are scarved out from the walls .Make your own photos instead of the photo service which offered around the entrance.
50,Tajmahal,Did not disappoint,"This was one of the main things I wanted to see in India, as it is with most people. Go there early in the morning, just as the sun rises. You'll save yourself a lot of trouble and time. A beautiful building and landscape, it's great to wander around, sitting in the gardens, and taking in the site of this beautiful building. Originally, meant for a single grave, inside there are two: one for whom it was meant, and the other for the builder–it was somewhat of a joke by his son who did not like him. The marble is some of the finest I've seen in India and the designs are amazing. Your ticket will include a 500mL bottle of water."
50,Tajmahal,Stunning,Spectacular as you would expect. A lot of people there. Go there first thing in the morning to get the most from it.
50,Tajmahal,An example of Love & Engineering,"The Taj, A place which deserve at least a visit in your lifetime. it is one of the best example of Love and Engineering. The monument itself a beauty however I liked the hand carving design on door and other parts. Dont forget to carry you camera however you have to pay fee for that.  Tips : Best time to visit winters or if you are planning to go in early summer time then visit Taj early in the morning."
50,Tajmahal,A Must,"This was an amazing trip. Did a three day overland trip with Oceania. Taj Mahal was the highlight. A once in a lifetime must. Beware, very pushy vendors."
50,Tajmahal,Shwan,"Amazing place, you can't imagine how they built a building like this in 17th century and what a nice and powerful story behind it. But the people around there were unfortunately dangerous and cheaters, I mean most of those I have seen not all of them."
50,Tajmahal,7 wonders of world,I want to visit all 7 wonders of world and it's just start from agra. Great building with great look and great design. Love this place.
50,Tajmahal,Tips for Visit,"1. Enter for sunrise at Eastern gate  2. Arrive at gate well before opening, as line queues early, if you want to experience a small uncrowded few minutes  3. Note, the gate has separate lines for men and women. Also, typical of India, guides will cut the line with their clients.  4. Sunset best viewed from across the river vs on site  5. At the iconic bench Princess Diana's photo is famous for, there will be guides shooting their clients in an aggressive fashion; don't wait for them to conclude, just step right in and get your shot in between their clients. If they complain, ignore them. If they say there is some sort of line, ignore them.  6. Plan on two parts of the visit; one to photograph and one to let the camera alone and simply appreciate the architecture.  7. No need for guide, read up beforehand and experience at your own pace and leisure.  8. Consider blocking off two to three hours total.  Enjoy!"
50,Tajmahal,THE Taj Mahal,Everyone sees THE Taj Mahal from within the main grounds. This is a good thing and there is nothing wrong with it. BUT IF you have time hire a ricksha and go across the Yamuna River to Mehtab Bagh and look back at THE Taj from this viewpoint. If you do this I don't think you will be disappointed.
50,Tajmahal,What a magnificent structure!!,"I have been to India many times, but have never been able to pull off a visit here. It was well worth the many decades wait. I have seen many magnificent buildings in my lifetime, but there is none that compares to this one. I had high expectations for it, and it exceeded them by far. Really worth seeing. I will now have to take my kids to see it sometime. I would be glad to see it again. There are, as all tourist destinations have, some distractions of people trying to sell you souvenirs and trinkets. Fortunately, they are not as pushy as I thought they would be. It is easy to ignore them. Just outside, I found a place to eat that was very nice, called The Silk Road. In addition, also ended up buying a handmade Persian rug. Also, very close by."
50,Tajmahal,You will not understand what is Taj before you visit this.,Taj is one of the most outstanding place in India. I have visited this with my wife. The creation can not be believed until it is seen. Everything is outstanding here. A must see place in India.
50,Tajmahal,"Unmistakeable, Unmissable and Unforgettable","Many consider the Taj Mahal to be the seventh wonder of the world. Description is almost beyond words, it is unmistakeable, unmissable and unforgettable. The Taj is a symbol of love commissioned by Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favourite wife. Finished in 1653 I am told that the work took 22 years and up to 20,000 craftsmen worked on the site every day. For one of the world's most recognisable and iconic buildings, up close it is simply stunning. The ivory and white marble, inlaid with rubies and malachite give the building its distinctive markings. The whole site is breathtaking and inspiring and yet, with the clever use of water, peaceful and tranquil.  We arrived at the Taj at 6am, just after sunrise, which I would recommend as not only are the crowds small in number, but the early morning sunlight adds to the magic of the occasion. It is absolutely worth hiring an official guide to provide valuable insights into the history and construction of the Taj Mahal, but will also be available to take your photograph whilst sitting on the ""Princess Diana"" seat. It is worth bearing in mind that the site is closed for cleaning on a Friday. All in all an unforgettable experience, not to be missed. For as an Indian once said, love was not invented in India, but it was perfected there."
50,Tajmahal,Simply Beautiful,"The Taj Mahal is definitely one of the most beautiful places in the world and a must see for anybody travelling to India. It's located in Agra and is about 200 km from Delhi. There is so much to explore and it's also well maintained. If you go, plan at least half a day, it's so worth it. If you're not familiar with the Indian culture - don't wear ""skimpy dresses"" the best thing to do especially if you keep the warm weather in mind is to wear some beautiful Indian clothes."
50,Tajmahal,Spectacular!,Such an awesome piece of history! We had this on our bucket list & so pleased that we had the opportunity to see this amazing work that has been wonderfully maintained. Had our picture taken on the same bench that the prince & princess had done a few days prior!
50,Tajmahal,Wah taj,One can't miss in its life time .......... what a place what a architecture no words to express this beautiful monument
50,Tajmahal,Wonder on earth,"You can not write review on Taj. For my friends..advice is: Take VIP gate Always consider a official guide Carry i card Non indians need to pay extra bucks Ask for shoe covers available at 10 inr on ticket countet Do not miss horse cart ride 200 inr U can also take battery car Ask questions from guide they can run faster due to time Avoid any visits to handicrafts suggezted by guides, might be wasting your time or money Take a photo at diana bench"
50,Tajmahal,The ultimate best in india! Exceeds all your expectations 😀,"Magnificent marble palace. We woke up at 4:45pm , went to lobby of Oberoi hotel to meet our hired guide who helped us buy entrance tickets and we were shuttle by the Oberoi Amarrvillas by gold cart to the east side entrance where we were pretty much in the beginning of the line. You cannot take handbags. Our guide had a little tote that he carried extra waters and slip covers to enter the area where you must remove your shoes . Everyone goes thru metal detectors and gets checked for possible guns etc. Gate opened exactly around 5:45am. It's cool in the early morning but very soon it gets hot. Go with a guide ! They will explain you the whole story Z worthy . They also know awesome places to take pictures and what kind of pictures to take. Everyone should go visit at least once in their life Below is example of entrance fee for non Indians ( of course foreigners pay more )."
50,Tajmahal,A visit to the Taj,As usual the visit to TAJ was exciting. We had a good guide with us which made the walk more exciting. Its very important to have a knowledgeable guide and it would be very important to keep on asking more question to get more answers.
50,Tajmahal,Breathtaking!,"Breathtakingly and magnificent! We visited the Taj Mahal on a Thursday afternoon in April. It was very hot, and we knew it would be hot, but I'm glad we made the journey even in the heat! A few tips: If it is a busy time, I would definitely recommend getting a guide who can get you through the lines faster. Also, you cannot wear shoes inside, so you have the option of shoe coverings or going barefoot. The ground gets very hot, so I recommend the shoe coverings, which seemed to be free with a foreigner ticket. If you are able, go early in the day or late in the day. Also, they are closed on Friday, so plan accordingly."
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj boliye!!!!!!!!,A monument of love. Nothing in the world beats taj for its beauty and serenity. With over 2.4 million visitors every year this is the most popular monuments to be visited by foreigners. If you have been to Agra you cannot miss this. I have been to this place twice already and can visit again. The sheer beauty and peace that it emits is food for your soul. This is one of the places that you should visit before you die. Time to visit is November to February. Also they have night tour of taj if its going to be a full moon night then you should opt for night tour obvious they will show you from the outer gates because of security reason. But the glory of Taj in the moonlight is worth seeing. No doubt 5 stars *****
50,Tajmahal,Can anyone give the Taj less than five stars?,"The Taj Mahal is certainly a white marble wonder with a most interesting history. However my visit took place during a very dry period in Agra and the dusty environment was a bit off-putting and probably hazardous. The early morning visit still resulted in long ""tourist"" lines and a long wait for bags to be searched. In fact while leaving a few hours later I noticed that there were much shorter lines. (I am speaking only about the foreign tourist entry.) Of course the Taj is always crowded but there are a few quiet spots to sit and contemplate. Something needs to be done about the monkeys: one almost attacked a tourist who was taking pictures, startling everyone around. I should add that the view of the Taj Mahal at sunset from the nearby park was charming. I just wish that Agra itself was less busy and crazy. The stars are for the fantastic monument itself."
50,Tajmahal,Exceeded expectations,"You know when you see pictures of a famous place all your life, then you finally visit that place and you think, ""meh,"" I can check that off. The Taj Mahal is not that. It's the opposite of that. It was so much more beautiful and impressive in person than I could have imagined. It's not just the white marble with the intricate gem stone inlays and relief carvings. It's also it's sheer size - about 25 stories tall. And the story behind it's construction. It is sincerely beautiful. The mic drop of all other famous monuments."
50,Tajmahal,what a love story !,This must be the most beautiful monument to love ever. It completely blows your mind as you walk through the massive gateway and are confronted by this fabulous marbke edifice. The token of one mans very deep love for his wife. It is exquisite .
50,Tajmahal,Best with a guide,"We had a guide take us on a tour through the monument. The workmanship and detail in the construction is amazing and it continues to look nearly flawless even though it was built in the 17th century. Guides are relatively inexpensive. Access for adults was 1000 rupees paid to the government (cash) to get an entry ticket. Shoe coverings are given as part of admission, so don't be fooled by those trying to charge for this nor by guides who claim they include it in their fee. It is part of the 1000 rupee admission to get shoe coverings. Be warned, the crowds can be significant and pickpocketing can be a problem. Watch your pockets!"
50,Tajmahal,splendid,"what a beautiful building . worth the heat and sweet . best to visit early morning , less busy . close on Friday so try to avoid this."
50,Tajmahal,Adventure in India,"This is a breath taking place, the monument of love, awesome, a lot of walking, so wear comfortable shoes and clothing, this is a short in and out visit, in hot weather take an umbrella, u'll need it."
50,Tajmahal,Simply the Best,An experience that I would advise you all very much. Visit the Taj Mahal is one of those things to do at least once in life. The beauty of the place is commensurate with his reputation(romantic) and its history. To visit well the whole complex serves time to us more than two hours.
50,Tajmahal,Seven wonders of world,"Yes, its a heritage site. Very big campus. To inter there there was king quee for ticket and then long quee for sercurity check to go inside but it was worth if waiting and get inside the Taj mahal. Different kind of mearval used to make it"
50,Tajmahal,"amazing, lovely","its the purest form of showing love by a King to her beloved. there is love everywhere the moment one enters in. finest mughal architecture, combination of Persian, Arabic and Indian. one of the seven wonders of the world, must for any traveller vising India, just 2 hours from N Delhi"
50,Tajmahal,Worth coming to India. Absolutely magnificent.,"The Taj was over and above my expectations. It is easy to read up on its history, so I won't do that. Even though there were lots of tourists, there was quite a peaceful feeling there. When you walk through the arch, there it is. There is long paths leading up to the Taj through nice gardens. The whole area is very clean and tidy. I walked through it and all around it and it was fabulous. A must see. I never thought I would go to India, but I did want to see the Taj Mahal and I am so glad I have. Even if you are not a fan of India, this is worth the trip."
50,Tajmahal,Magnificent,"Absolutely stunning! 1000 is kind of pricy but, hey... It's the Taj Mahal! Can say no more, you have to see it for yourself! Worth it all the way!"
50,Tajmahal,Excellent n excellent....,Wonderful experience...its really a world heritage........I was here for 1st wedding anniversary and amazing experience......must visit for beautiful stone work no color used in architecture wala next visit very sooon
50,Tajmahal,Amazing place,"It's hard to believe how beautiful and peaceful this extraordinary monument is, it was the last place we visited in a month of incredible India , this surpassed my high expectations .We visited at 1500 hrs , the crowds were less and we never felt rushed or overwhelmed"
50,Tajmahal,Magnificent Architecture and Art Display: One of the Bucket List,"The very first view of the Taj Mahal was from a highway coming form Dehli heading toward Agra. Although the weather was somewhat hazy, the edifice was magnificent. We devoted if necessary a full day to tour one of the top wonders of the world. As we approached the entrance which was about a mile from the main gate,we stopped and ought a transport ticket to take us to the gate. No private vehicles were allowed beyond this point. Our driver and the guide was very helpful as many visitors and tourists were ""fighting"" for a seat on the transporting vehicle. My wife on wheelchair was more difficult to quickly squeeze onto the transporter. After waiting more than an hour, our driver and the guide was able to secure the seats on transporter. Taj Mahal has it's own uniqueness like many other wonderful we've visited. The fine inlaid stones on the flat stone walls were very impressive. This facility is not handicap friendly."
50,Tajmahal,A Breathtaking Experience...even with the scaffolding,"The Taj didn't disappoint, unlike many hyped places. They may soon price ""foreigners"" out of the place though. The price for foreigners just keeps rising!  If you are at all claustrophobic, skip the viewing the interior replica tombs. First you will see a ""silence"" sign, requesting that you respect the reverence of the place. Then a man with a shrill whistle will herd you into a crowded one way line around the tombs. Very dank experience with not much too see and more close contact with others than I prefer."
50,Tajmahal,Incredible,"Every time I get the chance to go Agra when I'm in India I visit this amazing place, it's beautiful and must visited when you come India, is magical and unique, I love it every time, don't get tired of visit this awesomeness!"
50,Tajmahal,Taj mahal,"Nice but yellow....... outstanding,good place,nice buliding,superb architecture,nice river bank,nice people,nice girls to see ....me...."
40,Tajmahal,Fantastic but spoilt by the crowds.,No one could say this is not an iconic building and the setting is wonderful but I found the atmosphere far from romantic as we visited on a Sunday when there were crowds of other tourists. It is very difficult to avoid this situation unless you choose your time very carefully. The view is stunning from a distance but the closer you get the more people you encounter. The building containing the tombs is very disappointing as you are part of a queue which is hurried around so you are unable to have a proper view through the highly ornate carved screens. The gardens are lovely and the effect of the sun on the white building is well worth waiting for. Apologies for my somewhat jaundiced review but it is worth carefully planning your visit time. We had no choice as we were part of an organised excursion.
40,Tajmahal,need to see,friends if you are coming agar then you need to see TheTaj Mahal because once you this memorial building then you will be lucky person
40,Tajmahal,Awesome place,"Truely wonder, simply superb. Great master piece of architecture. Truely India's pride. Nothing can replace a beauty like Taj Mahal"
40,Tajmahal,Awesome monument that should be better kept,"We visited at sunrise, which was a blessing, as the park was not so crowded. Premises looked a bit neglected, too much litter next to the guesthouse and too many pigeons, that should be discouraged from inhabiting the Taj. We were pleasantly surprised by birdlife in the garden. Amazing variety, very pleasant to watch"
40,Tajmahal,See it once....,"The Taj Mahal is definitely a must-see if you can get there, but you'll only need a few hours, and take a guide. The surrounding areas are the definition of tourist traps - shops, pan handlers, photographers, and on and on, so be prepared. The Taj itself is magnificent, but can get very very crowded. The grounds are massive so dress comfortably and prepare for a walk."
40,Tajmahal,Waah Taj,Impeccable it is.Was speechless after visiting it .It looks so beautiful even after more than 350 years of being built.lifetime memory and experience.
40,Tajmahal,Hot,Too hot to visit. You will go all sweat . The temperature is quite high not a good time to visit though you will get shoe covers
40,Tajmahal,Exploring Indian History,"An impressing building in itself, the Taj Mahal also represent the integration of Muslim and Hindu communities over time. I think this is a beautiful and significant landmark that is a must see.  However, be aware of crowding. There are apparently on average 40.000 visitors every day to a relatively small garden and building. Ask for the VIP ticket that help you bypass congestion. I used a guide to help out with this arrangement."
40,Tajmahal,Wear Comfortable shoes Easy to Kick Off,"I am sure you read enough reviews. Just some advice. Go early in the morning, most Indians appreciate leaving their homes later. That is a good way to avoid crowds. Take a sun umbrella and a good camera. Picture time is before the crowds. You can return later in the day for sunset photos."
40,Tajmahal,Nice place to visit once in life,Its a nice place to go. Although it was very crowded to go inside where Mumtaj'z mukhbara was kept. Over all the place is very beautiful . I went there in the month of March so the weather was pleasant and the floor was not getting very hot. Please avoid going to visit this place during extreme summer. You will have to remove your shoes and walk which could be difficult during summer. But at the end its all worth it.
40,Tajmahal,White marble,"Taj Mahal is a place to see. You should go there early in the morning - we entered at 6 a.m. It is not yet too hot and it is not yet to crowded and sunrise ""light"" makes miracle with Taj. Inside there are very interesting thinks made by marble and some special stones brought from different places such as RSA, Iran,... You could by some special souvenirs made by this procedure in local shops. They are very expensive but they worth it."
40,Tajmahal,New Rules for Bags! Officious Officials!!!,"I knew that only small bags containing water and a camera were allowed on entry to the Taj. Both these items were in my bag and nothing else...I was told that my bag was too big and had to use a locker! A kind shop owner near the east gate entrance offered to look after it for me, for a look round his store when I came out. Once inside lots of other people had bags of a similar size, so please be aware this maybe only on entry from the east gate!!!! The guide I used cost Rs100 an hour an was informative although trying to rush I slowed him down to take in this wonderful place. Go as early as you can and there are fewer crowds. Rs1000 for foreign tourists entrance."
40,Tajmahal,Awesome up close or far,"Soon after lunch, we all piled back into our mini-bus for the trip to see the Taj Mahal. Our guide restated the rules about what not to bring, so I left my whole fanny pack in our room and Manoli went through her day bag and camera bag to be safe. We had no problem with security, except the lady asking what was in the little pouch of the camera bag, as she opened it, and I told her memory cards, so she just unzipped and rezipped and waved us through. There is a rule about no gasoline-burning vehicles being allowed within 1 kilometer of the Taj, so we had to park a ways outside. I think the rule is to keep the smog pollution from ruining the marble. We picked up our tickets, complimentary bottle of water, feet covers for the marble floors, and boarded an electric mini-bus. When we were dropped off near the East Gate, the guide asked if anyone had any of the forbidden items, and sure enough one of our ladies had pens and lipstick and another had two bottles of sunscreen and face cream, so he left them with a friend outside the gate. The streets closest to the Taj Mahal are full of souvenir vendors, along with the typical food, drink, and snack vendors. Our guide told us we had until 7pm, But we were back soon after 6pm.  The East Gate was beautiful enough, but when we passed through the gate to the Taj Majal, we got our first view of it up close. Absolutely beautiful! We stood just past the entrance and took several of the classic photos before investigating further. Before visiting the Taj Majal, we'd been told by our tour guide that we should visit the small museum on the grounds since they closed earlier. The museum was free, probably because it was part of the premium tickets we got. The museum was fairly interesting, showing a lot of documents and artifacts from the construction of the Taj Majal. After the museum, we headed to the Taj Majal, avoiding a fairly long line with our premium tickets again. After seeing the magnificent outside, the inside was a bit disappointing.  Before we entered, we all had to put on our foot covers to not get dirt on the beautiful floors. We followed a constant stream of folks through most of the rooms and out the back door, where almost everyone just took off their foot covers and dropped them on the outside sidewalk. What a mess. I'm not sure the inside was worth the time and money, but the outside up close sure was. Unfortunately at the time we were there, they were doing some shoring up or restoration on a couple of the corner towers, so it was quite as beautiful as it might have been, All and all though, the tour was worth it."
40,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal visit once only,This place comes in 7 wonders and no doubt in it but when I was present there repairing work was going on so look which I saw in TV or photos was not there. But view of yamuna was mesmerizing.
40,Tajmahal,World wonder,"The taj Mahal is a stunning piece of architecture. We were expecting a lot but when we went, they were restoring it and we couldn't have a perfect view. The gardens are so beautiful as well. We had to wear shoe covers as you are not supposed to wear footwear inside the taj Mahal premises. The guide services here are excellent but one has to be very careful while selecting the guide and photographers. Beware of the people who say that they are selling original marble but most times they are fake. If you wanna buy a real miniature of Taj Mahal, you could get it from the Govt. shops."
40,Tajmahal,Stunning monument,"I visited the Taj Mahal with a group. I was impressed with the organisation of the ticket booths. The security was very high in contrast with the throng of rickshaws, tuk tuks, cars and people outside. It was a short walk through some highly decorated arches to the beginning of the canal that leads to the Taj Mahal. Incongruously there was a dog in the water. The place was very crowded and very hot. You could approach the building and walk round it. Two of the minarets were surrounded by scaffolding obviously in preparation of the Royal visit the week after. Also several groups of people were working on different areas of the site. Some more benches would be a good idea for the older less fit of the. visitors."
40,Tajmahal,A quickie with the wonder of the world,"This was a last minute trip planned to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. We left New Delhi at about 6:30 am and were at the Taj by about 10:00 a.m. thanks to a wonderful new expressway. It was a quickie visit since we had a 5:40 pm flight out of Delhi so we were pressed for time throughout. Not the ideal way to do the trip but we didn't have any other option.  Agra is hot for most of the year so make sure you are wearing comfortable walking shoes and a cap. Water is permitted to be carried and ensure you carry your own bottled water. I'd avoid buying the stuff available outside the monument although its available should you fall short. Within the monument itself, no water is sold. The monument itself is open from sunrise till sunset. I'm told the early morning visit is stunning and you will beat the heat and the crowd but didn't have an opportunity to check that out.  As you approach the entrance, a number of guides come up to you. While i'm not sure about the rest of them, i ended up hiring a chap called Asif (M:+91 9358525025). While one is often wary of hiring such guides, my experience was that hiring him was pure bang for the buck. First of all, his fees are negotiable - i bargained hard down to about $10 but would have happily paid more at the end, and i did throw in a healthy tip since i was happy. Anything up to $15 is a good deal. If you want, call his mobile and schedule a visit - i think he'd be happy to book a slot in advance! That way you don't have to worry about haggling when there.  He stood in line and got us the tickets to enter the monument. He also picked up the necessary shoe covers (cant enter the monument without them - its good since in the past, you'd have to remove your shoes outside which led to theft). Seeing a big line to enter from the main gate which meant atleast a 30 minute wait, he took us in through a side entrance which saved us time - which was precious since we were doing a daytrip to the Taj Mahal from Delhi and had only a couple of hours.  Good, succinct details provided about the monument and the complex itself. Not too heavy for us to digest. He was able to speak in English, Hindi, French and even Arabic! Good chap!  The monument itself is something else. You can visit the real underground tomb only during certain days in May of each year. Otherwise, one can only see the (exact) replicas that are kept upstairs (one floor up). The staircase is blocked through the year otherwise. The entrance to the minarets has been shut and one cant go up. Marble inlay work on the entire monument is beautiful and its intricacies must be appreciated. The stones also shine at night - your guide will show you the effect using a flashlight.  Spend some time sitting on the marble on the outside once you are done seeing the inside. It can be quite surreal and allows you to be transported back in time.  The guide (Asif) was happy to take pictures using our cellphone at all places. Quite competent too since he knew all the hidden angles and ways by which one can make the pics all the more special. Don't waste money by hiring the photographers that come to you outside. Better use your guide to click snaps on your own device.  All in all, a superb trip and i'd definitely recommend hiring this guide to anyone who wants to visit. Reasonable, friendly, not out to fleece and happy to adjust to your needs.  Have a good trip!"
40,Tajmahal,interesting story,"This is a very interesting monument. So see the detail of the work, out into this, it is just amazing. And it's easy to see what the plan has been all the way from the start. and if you come here, then go see the Black Taj Mahal also, it is on the other site of the river, it is only the foundation, but it gives a great view of Taj Mahal, and you can easy see how the Black should be a ""copy"" of the white Taj Mahal."
40,Tajmahal,Incredible india,"An amazing site to see beautiful architecture and gardens in amongst the hustle and bustle of India. Be careful with your guide, ours was great at pushing people out of the way to take photos of us! But he didn't give us much insight into the history. And definitely take care of you belongings , my husband found a little boys hand in his pocket which he luckily was able to quickly move away from and we'd hidden all our valuables but you can be easily robbed in the crush of people."
40,Tajmahal,人多擠擁 但值得一遊,"這是一座非常漂亮的白色大理石建築，她背後的故事亦很淒美。 這裏每天都有很多參觀者，當地的、外國的，如果你是外國遊客，你買的是遊客入場券，你便可以不用跟隨當地的人龍，而可直接進入大殿。  This is a very lovely white marble architecture with a beautiful story as well. It is always crowded with visitors both locally and from overseas. If you buy a tourist ticket, you don’t need to follow the long queue and can go straight into the monument."
30,Tajmahal,Too hot during summers,Request all not to go during the month of May. There is washrooom facility and water inside the Taj Mahal. Mornings of Summer are hectic.
30,Tajmahal,Impressive architecture,"The architecture and history of the place is worth going, but the prices and masses of people can be really anoying what made it difficult for me to really enjoy the place. I think going there really early in the morning, the earliest tour that can be done must be the best option if you really want to enjoy the beauty and silence of the complex."
30,Tajmahal,A bit of a disappointment,"Emperor Shah Jehan built the Taj Mahal as a mausoleum for his beloved queen Mumtaz Mahal. Marble was brought from Makrana, near Jodhpur and precious stones were carried to Agra from Persia, Russia, Afghanistan, Tibet, China and the Indian Ocean. Whilst I get the scale and importance of this monument, I was left feeling that here was a man who was probably insane!"
30,Tajmahal,Tajmajal is getting dirty day by day,"I had visited taj mahal in the past almost 6 yrs ago. Visited again recently, it looks so dirty. Though the cleaning work in progress, it is loosing its glory"
30,Tajmahal,Do not go while scaffold is still up.,"Disappointing while the scaffolding is still up around three of the four minarets. They are being cleaned as Taj Mahal is turning yellow from polution. You just could not get a great photo as scaffold is too distracting. Wait until job is finished before going there. Have a guide waiting for you as you will miss all the line up's. Another guide will offer to take photos ($6 each) of you for a price! I gave him 500 rupees ($7.50) to come with me and show me the spots and took my own photographs. Don't get sucked into going to the sideshows and shops. You will waste a lot of time and end up buying something you do not want! In my opinion the Taj Mahal is not the 7th wonder of the world, Corbett National Tiger Park is (see other review)."
30,Tajmahal,Beautiful Monument,The Taj has always been an iconic place to visit and of course when my 5 ur old asked to see the Taj I had to take her despite the heat. We even payed for the overhyped night view of the Taj .. Too many police presence ( I understand that the threat is real to save the monument ) but where the barricade stops us at night is just too far to even see the Taj clearly.. Hate the fact that the footies being sold on the street are not sold as a part of the ticketed package helps the pain of haggling!! Seen the poor foreigners being looted. Since I grew up in India and speak the local language it's not too difficult for me to get a better deal. But all said and done !! Once in a lifetime must visit!!! Carry enough water and winter would be a better time to visit.
30,Tajmahal,Disappointed!!!,"Wish Taj was as beautiful as I had envisioned it to be. Pale yellow, over crowded, peeling paints and chipped stonework.... It was Majestic no doubt,close to each Indians heart, transportation to the Taj very well managed. I wish this jewel is revived before it no longer remains the wonder of the world."
10,Tajmahal,Be careful,"It goes without saying that's it's one of the wonders of the world... It's as magnificent as it is beautiful and everyone should see it while they can.  This review is based on everything outside the gates... As Indians, but foreigners even we didn't expect the kind of onslaught on bizarre men hounding us to pay them to be our tour guides/photographers/ricksaw drivers from the parking lot to gate (about 500 meters). It started on the drive up to the west gate (the best gate to get in from)... Literally chasing our car until we parked... Barely letting us out of the car, and then proceeding to follow us the rest of the way. Wherever one would stop, 2-3 would begin. It was overwhelming, annoying and disgusting... In many ways it takes away from the actual beautify the moseleum is. As foreigners, here's the basic you need to know... 1. Security is tight to enter... But anyone can enter with a ticket so be careful of pickpockets 2. no backpacks or day packs allowed... Women's purses are, but will be X-rayed 3. No food of any kind whatsoever is allowed and only water is permitted past security 4. Posted rate for non India residents was 1000 rupees... It comes with cold water, and shoe covers 5. If you take a tour guide, you bypass all line ups.  We ended up taking a tour guide after purchasing the ticket... He acted as our photographer with OUR camera, not his own.  Perhaps this was written prior... Figured I'd write a review because clearly we were not expecting that. Being the tourist Mecca that it is, you would think it would be better and safer experience for people."
45,Tajmahal,WAH TAJ...,"i think TAJ doesn't require a review. But i will share me day at TAJ. I have been to this place with my office colleagues, as i was in Agra on a official trip. As we entered people were asking us to hire them as guide. But we thought, we knew more than what they can tell us. Hence, we didn't hire one. We went inside,took pictures of TAJ, the extreme beauty in front of my eyes. i kept staring at the monument. n was thinking if i were to built for mine MUMTAJ, would i have been able to do so. The answer still remains a mystery.. Anyway the overall experience was great. The original makhbara is said be in lower chambers, where the public is not allowed to go."
45,Tajmahal,Excellent,It is most beautiful and must visit. Gets very crowded on holidays. In Christmas there were 2 lac visitors with a 2 hour queue. Take a shuttle from parking.
45,Tajmahal,一個人的印度之旅。。泰姬陵之旅,"Nice and pretty place . You can enjoy and feel pace there. Building were amazing. I love it, wish next time can visiting in the evening. Because I heard it will different then daily time."
45,Tajmahal,Heaven,Don't read review just go and enjoy the beauty and magnificent architecture. Make sure you plan your trip in winter's
45,Tajmahal,DO NOT MISS,Can't put into words how good the visit was Much much better than I had anticipated Vist very early (6.00am) for crowd free look
45,Tajmahal,No. 1 Unique Place,AS i had heard about The TAJ found more than it and it is really amazing place on the earth. must recommend to go once visit and feel the TAJ.
45,Tajmahal,Words don't quite work...just go and see it,Certain places build up a great aura of anticipation which they fail to deliver on. Not the Taj: all the superlatives are true so just make sure that you go and imprint it on your memory for ever. Sunrise is a lovely time to visit to watch the changing colours on the marble but is now very popular. Make sure that you are at the ticket office about half an hour before it is due to hit to cope with ticketing and security delays. Currently there is scaffolding around three of the free standing minarets which takes a little of the sheen off the experience. Try and stay for a couple of hours to walk all round. You can find certain paths that are quite free of people.
45,Tajmahal,The Great Taj,One of most fantastic sight for me india the legend of india taj will gives you impressive look on the first seen. Beware of the touts for selling tickets on front gate just go the taj management.
45,Tajmahal,Everything I expected,"On many travellers' bucket lists, the Taj Mahal was worth waiting for. Just beautiful. We were there for the sunrise. Of course the sun struggled through the haze and smog but the light on the TM did change wonderfully. Lots of touts and street vendors outside but inside wasn't too bad. Separate security queues for ladies and men as is the norm in India. Mosquitoes were quite bad while waiting for the gates to open."
45,Tajmahal,Simplicity personified as beauty,"An amazing experience. It's design & artistry just beautiful. Make sure you visit the fields behind the Taj Mahal for a great sunset view. Avoid guides taking you down little back streets to see it from some roof top. The experience of the back streets will truly be off putting & spoil the entire experience! Oh, and go early to visit it, the crowds can be also off putting by 10am."
45,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,"What an amazing place. You can look at photos of this place but it is nothing like actually being there. There is a special feeling about it and you can easily immerse yourself in the atmosphere & euphoria. My only wish would have been to stay longer, a truly spiritual & reflective experience."
45,Tajmahal,Awsome simply awesome!,My Fourth visit to this fabulous monument..! Very strict regarding cleanliness.. Very organised.. Very impressive..
45,Tajmahal,the wonder. the epitome of love. the Taj Mahal,"you will have to behold the magnificence of Taj Mahal by yourself as words are definitely not sufficient and incapable of describing its beauty to you. avoid travelling between April, May and June if possible as the hot sun will be scorching during those months."
45,Tajmahal,A Remarkable Monument,"One should visit this monument once in a lifetime. A true monument of love. Taj Mahal is full of remarkable workmanship. The marble and craft are outstanding. To preserve it, no engine vehicles are allowed to go near except electric car and horse cart. The entrance fee is INR750 for foreigner."
45,Tajmahal,Antipodeans Abroad,"Took a school group, amazing building, surprised by how many locals come to visit the place. Great to be able to walk around and explore."
45,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal - does not disappoint !!!,"Fabulous, amazing, wonderful !!! Before booking however, check to make sure they are not cleaning the exterior otherwise it will be covered with scaffolding."
45,Tajmahal,Must visit and its above all descriptions !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Must visit and its above all descriptions i went to this place as just a visit to a historic monument but its above all my expectations .Each and every corner talks about history you need a proper guide which will make the visit real worth,the efforts taken to maintain it is really commendable.About the monument i dont think it can be made anywhere else in the world again.Proper visit require at least 3-4 hours.To sum it up it is a real wonder!!!!!!!"
45,Tajmahal,Breathtaking building,"This was really one of the best experience in India. The only one thing which was not so good, was the fee. As usual in India tourists have to pay much more than Indians just because they are tourists. When you buy a ticket, there are many guys who want to be your guide and the always tell you it is for free and you can give only some tip. But at then end it is really expensive. Better is to take an audio guide. The building is really majestic and beautiful, you have to see it when visiting Agra. It is very clean over there, you just cant believe it is in India! That is why you cant take any food or drink, for example gums, because there is a risk that you can throw some waste there. Be careful because one day in week it is closed, I think it was Friday but I am not sure."
45,Tajmahal,Beautiful Monument,"Taj Mahal is beautiful Monument.It Attracts you towards it.The amazing geometric architecture will Amaze you.Some people says Taj Mahal is just a building but Its Far far more than just a Building.If you read about Taj Mahal and then visit it and see the details over there, You will like it a lot. Every time when I visit Taj, I love it more than before."
45,Tajmahal,Go to the garden in the back of the Taj for the best photos!!,"As you may already know, the Taj Mahal is the most photographed building in the world, therefore you can only imagine the crowds and crowds of people that come to visit from sun up to sun down. Obviously if you're in Agra you'll have to battle the crowds and make your way inside the Taj Mahal as it is truly a wonder, but if you want clear uninterrupted pictures of this beauty you'll have to also visit the Mehtab Bagh, which is the garden behind the Taj from across the Yamuna River. I advise going for sunset as the lighting is superb, and you can make it to look as if you and your loved ones have the whole Taj Mahal to yourself! (well at least thats what it'll look like in pictures). Happy travels!"
45,Tajmahal,Beautiful once inside - beware of touts!,"The Taj Mahal is just one of those places that you can sit and marvel at for ages. Unfortunately not many people do, they are in and out before they get a chance to sit and appreciate this magnificent building. It was smaller than we had expected, though no less perfectly formed. Unfortunately it was very busy and we didn't get great shots as three of the four outside plinths are surrounded by scaffolding at the moment. Another disappointment was discovering that the pricing has recently jumped from 750rupees to 1000rupees per person (tourist price, not local price), but you get a free cold water included, which is a must on sweltering days. The area around the Taj is less awe inspiring and apart from a visit to Joney's Place for food, we thought it best not to dawdle in the less than desirable streets of Agra for longer than necessary."
45,Tajmahal,Heavenly Wonder of the World,"This is something which you MUST see in your life. The architechture, the art, the location, the beauty, everything about this building is grand. Wonderful wonder of the world."
45,Tajmahal,Just stunning - but don't get talked into photographs!,"We booked two visits to the Taj through Trailfinders on their Bespoke Tour of Rajasthan (Trailfinders was an absolutely brilliant travel company to deal with).  Trailfinders organised tour guides at all the sites we went to, but the guide at the Taj talked us into having 'official' photographs taken, which started off at 100 rupees (£1) for one photo. We thought this wasn't too bad so agreed. 64 photos later, and feeling thoroughly fed up with being told to pose 'Bollywood' style, we had to argue vehemently against paying £60 or all 64 photos plus a CD. After 30 minutes arguing we got him down to £10 for 12 photos - which were of very poor quality!  The only saving grace was that we had booked a sunrise visit to the Taj the following day. Our guide told us that it would be foggy at sunrise as it usually is that time of year, so it wouldn't be worth getting up early for as we wouldn't see anything. This proved to be good advice, and we went back at about 10.30 - the fog had cleared - and without the photographer we had a wonderful couple of hours, wandering around the Taj which is truly a magnificent building.  Local knowledge is crucial here - if we had only booked a sunrise visit to the Taj we would have been very disappointed. Another couple we spoke to had done this and were very sad that after looking forward to seeing it for years, they had booked a sunrise visit back in the UK and had got there at dawn in thick fog and consequently saw nothing of the Taj.  A stunningly beautiful building which we feel privileged to have been able to visit."
45,Tajmahal,Epic love story,"The monument lived up to our expectation. Stunning from every angle, especially mesmerizing at dusk and dawn. Make sure to take a lot of photos! I found that our best experience took place outside of the building since the inside was rather packed---not a good idea in the summer heat."
45,Tajmahal,If you are going to India you have to go here,"This is a mandatory spot to visit when traveling to India. The Taj Mahal is truly awe inspiring. Personally I enjoyed the visit to the tourist trap that my driver took me to where they have ""artisans"" carving marble and inlaying semi precious stones. It was educational for me despite knowing that it was a tourist trap."
45,Tajmahal,MIND BOGGLING,ohhh.... wat a beauty..... its a monument which makes us proud.... visited 6 th times.... still gets fascinated...
45,Tajmahal,beautiful,i can't believe elephants can build this. thanks @ankitgoldentriangle tours for guiding me.through this day
45,Tajmahal,awesome,Taj mahal is really wonderful & I fully enjoy the trip.It was my first trip to visit alone.But it was great experience for me .
45,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,"This is a must see for any traveler to India. Although it is a hassle to get in and out, one of the more expensive tourist sites, and can be pretty crowded, it is still worth the visit. The very first glimpse you have of the building takes your breath away. Make sure you have a good guidebook or get a guide to explain some the story behind the building and to explain the interesting design and architecture."
45,Tajmahal,"big minars a tomb, a river and architecture",taj mahal the best of mughal architecture in india rest of the world knows what is so good about this white monument...
40,Tajmahal,What more can I say?,"All the photos, videos and imagination did not prepare me for the real Taj.  Make sure you visit this place at least one in a life time.  Hiring your personal photographer near the ticket counter is very helpful. You can get printed copies of photos for less than a dollar by the time you come out. this will also ensure that they clear the crowd for you while taking pics."
40,Tajmahal,Perfect,"It is what you read and hear: very beautiful and something not to miss if you are visiting India. A little pity that two minarets are being restored and that the was no water, but still a wonder"
40,Tajmahal,Better in real life!,"It seems impossible, but the Taj Mahal is without doubt more impressive in real life than the photos. The detail of the marble inlay, the delicacy of the carved filigree and sculpted flowers transports the visitor to another world, despite the crowds."
40,Tajmahal,Amazing Experience!,"I had wanted to see the Taj Mahal for many years, but it wasn't until the November of 2015 that I was finally fortunate enough to see and experience it...It was well worth the wait. My guide in Agra took me to experience sunrise at the Taj Mahal and it was just unbelievable.  Glancing upon the Taj Mahal at sunrise for the first time from a distance from the arched gate, you see its true beauty. It was incredibly breath-taking and left me speechless. In front of me was one of the most beautiful and amazing wonders which I have ever seen. It was way better than how I ever imagined it and it truly surpassed my expectations. Truly a sight to behold.  The Taj Mahal looked like a scene and story from an Arabian Nights Tale, such was its splendour. The sunrise gave the Taj Mahal a lovely light pink hue. And it was like a beautiful and mesmerising dream, an absolute marvel. The colours of the Taj Mahal change throughout the different times of the day.  After taking its beauty in and after some excellent photo opportunities to capture its beauty, we walked closer to it, with a view to go inside. As you get closer, it becomes even more magnificent.  The Taj Mahal, which means Crown Palace, is not a Palace, which is very hard to believe when you see the incredible craftsmanship and architecture.  But it is actually a Mausoleum which was built by the Emperor Shah Jahan, Emperor of the Mughal Empire, for his most beloved and favoured wife Mumtaz. The Taj Mahal was built as testament of his promise of love for her.  As you get closer, you begin to see the amazing detail, craftsmanship and passion that went into creating this timeless masterpiece. You see absolutely gorgeous calligraphy with verses from the Koran carved on all four entrances and other Indo Islamic influenced artistic work decorated and carved into the white marble with different coloured and inlaid precious stones. I was truly captivated by its beauty from each angle.  And when we went inside the Taj Mahal and saw its amazingly decorated interior and the final resting place for Mumtaz and Shah Jahan, it was an experience.  The Taj Mahal was created to such perfection that it is perfectly symmetrical in each way. It was in fact the position of the Tomb of Shah Jahan that stopped the interior of being perfectly symmetrical, as Mumtaz's Mausoleum is in the middle and Shah Jahan's Mausoleum was placed next to hers at a much later time, thus breaking the symmetry.  Visiting the Taj Mahal was an absolutely amazing and a once in a lifetime experience and I could see why it is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The photos will never do it justice and it must be seen to be believed. I am very fortunate and grateful to have been able to experience this wonder."
40,Tajmahal,Felt Like a Dream,"If you ever find yourself visiting India, then this is without a doubt an absolute must on your itinerary. It's no surprise why this amazing example of architecture is considered a new world wonder. From the moment I walked in through the Royal Gate, it felt surreal. The amount of detail that went into this place is mind boggling. EVERYTHING IS SYMMETRICAL. Unfortunately when I visited they were doing maintenance and there was scaffolding on 3 of the 4 towers. A little disappointing but was still an amazing experience. I would definitely recommend getting a guide. It's nice to have someone inform you of all the detail and history behind it so you can truly appreciate everything you are seeing. Best time to visit in my opinion is sunrise when the gates first open since the crowds/lines are a lot shorter."
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful,"It is truly one of the wonders of the world. Impressive, the crowds and the heat can be a really annoying but don't let any of this to put you off. It is amazing. Don't stop to ask for prices from the street sellers on your way in or out or you'll soon be surrounded by a crowd trying to sell you anything and everything."
40,Tajmahal,TOOK MY BREATH AWAY,"Sometimes, I am a little disappointed by pictures and images, but this iconic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra took my breath away and it was just like I hoped it would be - and more.  It was built by the Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan, to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal who died in childbirth after giving birth to her 14th child.  Jewel like stones create beautiful designs. The Moguls perfected the art of embedding semi precious stones into marble. This has got to be seen to be believed.  Our guide was amazing and he remembered the days when as a child, he could roam the site and swim in the ornamental pools.  He relayed the story of the imperfections in the building because the Emperor was told that only God could create something perfect. He showed us these imperfections i.e. one of the carvings on the columns was deliberately made round instead of 5 sided.  The gardens were also delightful.  We went early in the morning so as to avoid the extreme heat of the day and before the monument got extremely busy.  A great thrill for me was to sit on ""Diana's"" seat with my husband and have our photograph taken with this magnificent monument as a backdrop.  Truly a magical morning and a must do if one is in Agra."
40,Tajmahal,Wonderful,"Hi , it is a visit of my life good with my partner, finally it is amazing construction of world wide as well as one of world monuments . there are number of pilgrims annually visiting this location. Prominently, super evacuation of the place."
40,Tajmahal,Magnificent!,"No visit to Agra is complete without a visit to the monument of love that is Taj Mahal. Words cannot do justice to describe the beauty of this architectural wonder! In summer, it is best to visit early morning to beat serpentine queues at the gates and escape the searing heat in order to truly enjoy the monument comfortably. This monument can be visited anytime of day during the winter months provided there's no fog/smog which can greatly hamper the view! For public convenience, the local govt. must tie up with all good hotels to offer tickets for purchase inside their premises."
40,Tajmahal,Outstanding,Even better than all the hype - truly a must see. Set in stunning grounds with a wide variety of wildlife around: watch out for the monkeys though - they are beyond bold.
40,Tajmahal,Awesome!! A marvel of art!! Must visit!,"I didn't know the Taj Mahal is so huge till I was there. And it is a truly marvel of art, almost unbelievable!! Get the audio, the history of building this architecture is quite mind boggling. Awesome!!!"
40,Tajmahal,An unforgettable masterpiece,"I loved the story behind the monument and really enjoyed the atmosphere.  Unfortunately, three of the minarets are under repair now and this may ruin your photography experience. You have to consider this for planning your trip if you are really interested in photography."
40,Tajmahal,Gorgeous at Sunset,"Of course, it is amazing. And huge! It is really something to see and pictures don't do it justice. If you can be there at sunset, do it."
40,Tajmahal,Peacful,One not to miss I loved the atmosphere so serene Sitting in the garden chatting to people tand aking lots of photos
40,Tajmahal,What can you say that's new?,"Yes, it's the Taj Mahal and yes, photos will never do it justice. Even at opening it's crowded but it's surprisingly easy to wander off to the side and enjoy the experience in relative solitude."
40,Tajmahal,exceeds expectations,"OK, so we have all seen countless images of the Taj, but to see it in real life is a spectacular event. It is simply - breathtaking. It is one of the not-to-be missed sights in Northern India, and with good reason. Given the expansive exterior, I was surprised at how small the interior is, just enough room for the two crypts occupying center stage."
40,Tajmahal,Amazing!,You read so much about the beauty of the Taj Mahal and it still manages to blow you away when you see it in person! Incredible!
40,Tajmahal,Best to plan early morning visit,"Beautiful, iconic and busy even in early morning. We toured at 7am before the worst heat of the day. Hired a tour guide, Roshan. On the plus side, he seemed to be in charge so could fast track through certain areas, takes pics for you, knows all good photo spots and was very knowledgable. On the down side, he made tour last two hours and we could have done without the last half hour. It was starting to get very hot, too many cheesy poses and some inappropriate jokes."
40,Tajmahal,Wonderful,What a beautiful piece of architecture. Ones you come here you can't go back. wonderful is the very small word for taj. Come n fill the smell of love.
40,Tajmahal,"No guides/photographer please, thank you!","The number of people trying to offer guide and photography services is incredibly annoying. If you survive to stay cool after this ordeal, you will get to enjoy the beauty of the Taj Mahal!"
30,Tajmahal,Somethong you just want to keep looking at,"This building ticks all the boxes, beautiful from every angle, a beautiful story and the history of the Mughal empire. On its own the marble work and carvings are incredible but when you add the jewels inlayed into the marble it becomes astonishing. We had been going to wander ourselves as I had read enough travel books but our guide Nishi from Nikita travel bought the place alive not to mention the photos he took for us. The photos he took with my windows phone are incredible. We deliberately travelled light so we would not have to store belongings. We wore long trousers, and carried our phone and money only. We had been warned not to take a torch and noticed how alert the police were to the use of camera and torch lights in the inner burial area. It was sat April 1 we visited about 8.15 am. The crowds were light and actually increased about 9.30 as did the heat."
30,Tajmahal,Beautiful taj mahel,Taj mahel really amazing .seven wonder of the world.veri good view in sun rise and sun sat.i visit with my family .
30,Tajmahal,Excellent!,"I've dreamed of visiting the Taj Mahal since I first saw it on a reel through my ViewMaster in the 50s. It lived up to my expectations. Our first glimpse was of the backside looking from the Mehtab Bagh gardens from across the river in the late afternoon. Our guide met us at our hotel the following morning and we arrived early to catch the sun as it shone on the white marble structure. Our guide, Cozi Kahn, was very knowledgeable and took photos of us using very interesting angles."
30,Tajmahal,Bucket List = Tick,"Breathtaking beauty. We had a guide take us round which i would recommend because they make it so interesting with their knowledge, and they know all the best photo places, they'll also take photos for you, saves keep asking strangers :) !"
30,Tajmahal,true love,good place to visit!!!!!!!!!!! loving is for ever! one thing to do is ..... i will come back to see what happen!!!
30,Tajmahal,Magnificent,"What to say? It's one of the best known sites in the world. There are long waits, even if you arrive early because people queue before opening. It's all worth it, it is a magnificent sight even with crowds who are absorbed by the gardens and sheer scale of the place."
30,Tajmahal,"One of the Seven Wonders, worth the visit","You can't come to India and not see the Taj Mahal! In some ways, it's exactly what you think it's going to be, you've seen the pictures, it's not really surprising, but it's also just really incredible to see in real life. Getting there in the morning is worth it; the mosquitos are out, but they dissipate quickly. Although you CAN bring in a bag, don't-- you'll get through the line more quickly, and watch out for people pretending to be a free guide. Your ticket includes a bottle of water and shoe covers, but NOT a guide, like many will tell you. Once inside, you'll also have a lot of men with large fancy cameras offer to take your picture, and then charge for it. The museum doesn't open until 9am, so if you get there early, you might want to sit on one of the nearby benches in the shade and wait for it to open.  The entire Taj is worth the trouble and a few hours wander-- it's similar to other monuments in India, but in a class above any that share architectural similarities."
30,Tajmahal,Must visit monuments in the world,"Taj mahal is one of the seven wonders in the world. Obviously an insanely popular place, and for many reasons. Large site with beautiful gardens"
30,Tajmahal,A human creation which human words can't define,Everyone would have written about this place - so I don't thing I can use any virgin words to define the beauty of this place.
30,Tajmahal,Wonder of the World,Everything that needs to be said about The Taj has been said. No words can describe this Beautiful Architecture.
30,Tajmahal,The Taj,"If anything that will take your breath away it is the Taj, What a majestic beautiful structure.I was in total awe of this building and the surrounds,the history it is a must visit."
30,Tajmahal,A must for any trip to India,Iconic and historic visit. Don't go without a tour guide to get the most of the rich history behind the Taj Mahal. There are washrooms on sight for 10 rupees.
30,Tajmahal,It is truly a significant site,What more can be said about this architectural masterpiece. The surrounding area from the entrance to this mausoleum is equally interesting and architecturally pleasing
30,Tajmahal,One of the greatest gifts of architechture,"Over the years, I had only heard people tell about the mesmerizing beauty of the Taj Mahal. With the help of Crystal India Holidays, I had the pleasure of visiting the Taj Mahal in Agra. The old world charm of Agra comes to life with the presence of this piece of architecture. I had the best possible time during the visit as Crystal India Holidays made the trip worthwhile."
30,Tajmahal,Taj - WAHHHH Taj,"Wonder of the world, indeed. Plzzzzz do not go on a weeked. Crowded and crazy out there on weekends. Take a train from Jaipur to Agra."
30,Tajmahal,My long awaited trip to Taj Mahal,"This beautiful historical monument is a must to visit place, I loved this masterpiece architecture and still wonder how they made so many years back. when you stand in front of the Mahal, you will feel it is moving on sky !!!"
30,Tajmahal,"In one word, Majestic.",Everything that needs to be said about the Taj has been said. It is beautiful a scene that will stick with you. There are photographers waiting and willing to take great shots. The prices are steep and negotiable.
30,Tajmahal,A Must See!,"Finally got a chance to visit the Taj. Just one word describes this beauty 'incredible'. An online booking is a must for a quick entry to the monument. Parking is available in both east and west gates. Entry through east gate is highly recommended as there is almost zero crowd there. We entered at 2pm post lunch and had an easy entry. Please do not take any food packets inside. However, a bottle of water is highly recommended. After security check you enter the monument. Do click a photo on the marble seating bench on the high rise platform. Next you climb on the platform of the Taj mahal. Do keep your shoes in the counter and take the plastic covers to wrap your shoes and please throw the plastic cover in the dustbin provided. I was very upset to see the plastic wrappers strewn everywhere near the monument. Next take a walk inside the masoleum. This could be bit claustrophobic considering the enormous crowd inside. Please beware of your belongings here. Next try to get rest in some benches on the side lawns and keep staring at the white beauty. Exit through west gate and you can either walk to the main gate or try an camel/horse ride for another experience."
30,Tajmahal,Nice Trip to Taj Mahal,Its a must place to visit for everyone. Taj look beautiful. Its always full of people there but everybody would be busy in taking pictures of Taj Mahal.
30,Tajmahal,A wonder of the world!!!,Its the TAJ MAHAL ffs ... A wonder of the world!!!!  How can someone give it less than 5 stars - there's something wrong with these people and what were they expecting!!!??  Go there ... Take photos ... Be amazed ... !!!
30,Tajmahal,Second time here..still in awe.,"Best to go early in the day as in gets crowded in late morning and afternoon onwards. In fact, going early would mean that you can get to explore the place completely! I remember going here for the first time but it was already crowded and I didn't manage to explore the other parts of the Taj. Recommended place to go in Agra but don't forget to visit the Mehtab Bagh(garden behind the Taj and across the river) for sunset!"
30,Tajmahal,Terrific Taj Majal,Taj Majal is more than a monument. It is a cultural experience that overwhelms the senses. Even visiting on the hottest day it was a magical adventure back in time.
30,Tajmahal,a place of aftertaste....,"i guess most people are of the same as me, before came here had been aesthetically fatigue of the image of this white building.... so why we came here in person? just to show that we had been there..... the day i was there (in last March) was a hazy day, was it good or not? good for your own, u'd see everything through the mist, felt a beauty of dim kind, especially the Yamuna River; but your friends would not agree that, 'cause they saw nothing on your pics..... i admit on that day i was not in good mood, feeling lonely after my friends leaving me for their own itinerary. Taj mahal didn't seem impressive to me at all. But later, when i came back home, after such a long period of time, when one day, i was reviewing the pics i took in india, including that very vague shadow of taj mahal i had witnessed from the agra fort, imagining what the emperor was feeling when he was doing so, i recognized the romance of Taj Mahal, that's something u can only understand when you have some one in your own heart....."
30,Tajmahal,Beautiful,Taj Mahal is a must visit place in India.It is very beautiful and mesmerizing.The true wonder of the world.
30,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,"I've been here 3 times, and i always amazed every time i enter the entrance gate. I start to hold my breath and the magnificent view in front of me brings me to the imagination of ancient time where the king start to build Taj Mahal. Taj Mahal absolutely deserve as one of seven wonders in the world."
30,Tajmahal,Good,"Great view,I love taj thats y I came here,I enjoyed alot and I would like 2 come once again,superb location and"
30,Tajmahal,Magic,We love to come to the Taj. I have been here many times with my family or only with my wife. We like to do the early morning visit. The weather is not so hot and it is not so crowded. We always stay at Amarvillas. It is an expensive property but the proximity and the view of the Taj are unmatchable.
30,Tajmahal,Indeed 7 wonders of the world,The most beautiful place I ever visited. We visited taj mahal at sunrise & a our 1st glance of the monument still fresh in my mind. No words to describe the beauty of Taj. I'm stunned
30,Tajmahal,Everything and more,I always thought that all this hype about the Taj was just that - hype - but the first second that you catch sight of this jewel you can't help but gasp - it shimmers - it seems to float - it seems somehow unearthly - get there early to avoid the crowds. If you are there for the full moon snag one of the 400 nightly tickets to see it like a ghost in the moonlight. For sunset go across the river to the Moonlight gardens to see it from a different perspective. Worth it in every way. Magical.
30,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,"Even after having already seen the Taj Mahal several times, each time I view it through the entry gate, I have to catch my breath. An absolute must-see for anyone visiting India."
30,Tajmahal,Spectacular!,"Understandably very busy so you may want to get there early in the day, but well worth the visit. Pictures don't do it justice. It is a beautiful place, amazing architecture and history, and not to be missed."
30,Tajmahal,Magnificent,"Unless you've seen it before, there's no excuse to not visit the Taj Mahal. We visited it twice to catch sunset and sunrise views."
30,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal,"If there is one thing worth seeing in life, then this is it, all built for the love of his wife. The Taj is surprising at the size of it, amazing and breath taking at the same time. You have to be there to appreciate it. Best to have a guide as they are able to give you the background. BTW there is a theatre production show in the evening ask your hotel about it, worth going to see it too. They will know."
30,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,What can I say. Very emotional and was amazed to see we could actually go inside the taj.  It was very packed but there was enough room to walk around and soak up the atmosphere.  The workmanship is spectacular.  Loved every second of being there.
30,Tajmahal,Bucketlist - TICK,"We arrived before dawn, and joined the short line. Unfortunately we got eaten alive by mosquitos while we waited. All of that was worth it once we entered and saw the most beautiful tribute to a loved one in history. they were cleaning two of the minarets when we were there, but it didnt take away from the magic & serenity of the Taj Mahal."
30,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,"What can I say? I've waited years to visit The Taj Mahal, and on walking through the archway my breath was taken away, emotions ran high and tears flowed , it is without doubt one of the most beautiful buildings I have ever see, so peaceful and serene, Tip go very early to beat the crowds and have your own private time, we got there for 6am , it's worth it."
30,Tajmahal,Wonderful visit,"Amazing ,what a fantastic day,just watch out for the touts,that surround you when you arrive. The place was spotless and not too busy when we were there, did buy the photo package but didn't really feel as if we're ripped off."
30,Tajmahal,Simply Amazing !!!!!!!!!!,"Wow but A masterpeice... Start early to enjoy the real beauty to escape the long queues as every one wants to be at this place. Worth waiting in que to see this beautiful monument. The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture, magnificent isn't it?"
30,Tajmahal,Stunning!!,"Unlike some attractions, the Taj Mahal is definitely not overrated in terms of its beauty. This absolutely stunning building and architecture leaves you breathless. I have visited the Taj Mahal many times and still find it spectacular. If you like history, this place is definitely for you as its seeped in Persian influence and heritage. The only setback is the harassment before you enter from touts etc. From personal experience you should go around 5am to avoid this. Also this is a beautiful time to see the sun rise and the moon go down on either side of the Taj Mahal – it really is earth shattering."
30,Tajmahal,Simply Stunning!,"What an impressive building!!! As someone who's a little OCD, this building is perfect! The symmetry and balanced design provide such a stunning scene. We went first thing in the morning at like 6am, the lines were a lot shorter and by the time we left around 830am, the crowds had swollen massively. On the grounds is also a beautiful mosque that gets neglected by the sheer beauty of the Taj, which is a shame as its worth checking out as well."
30,Tajmahal,Nice place to visit but crowded,"World famous, and for a good reason. Count about 2 hours for a visit. It can be very hot (we went in April). Foreigners pay much more than locals as entry fee (1000 INR against 40 INR), but for that you get to go through special lanes, i.e. you can skip the long queues. I understand it is closed on Fridays."
30,Tajmahal,What Else Can We Say: Amazing,"This is considered one of the seven modern wonders of the world. And it lives up to reputation.  We saw it from across the Yamuna River in the gardens (ticket sales until 6pm only) and it was really beautiful, a great prelude to our sunrise visit the next day.  We did the smart (lazy?) thing and hired a guide who was incredible and made the visit beautiful and memorable with context, stories and anecdotes. At dawn, the queue is long and it can take some time to get in, but it was worth the minor hassle - especially because our guide took care of everything.  Whether you are up close or far away, the Taj Mahal itself is quite beautiful. The precious stone inlays are stunning. The gardens are nice too but not fully operational (fountains not working, for example).  On the advice of our guide, we approached the Taj Mahal from one of the side paths - quieter and a great place for him to explain the history to us.  Note: It is closed on Fridays to non-muslims. Also note that modest attire is not a requirement."
30,Tajmahal,The Most Beautiful Building,The Taj Mahal was considerably more amazing than I imagined. This site is an absolute must see and makes all of the annoying things about India well worth it. I used a guide who mostly protected me from the touts as soon as I left my taxi; I recommend you arrange the same or you will be hounded.
30,Tajmahal,Amazing,The taj was going to be one of the main highlights of our 3 week trip to India and it didn't disappoint. Words just don't do it justice; you have to see it! Our guide was brilliant - the full story behind it is beautiful - will never forget it!
30,Tajmahal,Wonderful experience,Wonderful place to visit. Felt so proud to have this 7th wonders of world. I would like to recommend it to every one.
30,Tajmahal,Amazing monument to true love,"Two visits (again in March 2016) to this iconic building still can't fail to impress and photographs don't do it justice. Unfortunately on the latest visit two towers were being cleaned and scaffolding obstructed the magnificence of the building. One of the wonders of the modern World, should not be missed."
30,Tajmahal,Awesome beauty,One the finest place to visit. Reviews not required. Too many photographs wanting to click pics n try to sell it. Better to hire guide it helps. Don't go during summer's u will be roasted ...
30,Tajmahal,One of the great example of True love of Shah jahan,Taj Mahal is one of the great example of Mughal architecture & Shah Jehan's love towards his wife Mumtaj Mahal
30,Tajmahal,A beautiful place: DON'T forget the ID,"It is a wonderful place and worth the wait in the queue. But it would be nice if the authorities let people know that they won't be allowed to buy a ticket if they do not show their IDs.  Camera: you can always carry your still camera free of cost.  Audio guide: Available at the West Gate  It is difficult to explain Taj by words. It is marvellous. Take your time to walk around. The monument is made of stones from places round the world - Green jade from China, malachite from Russia, coral from Baghdad, carnelian from Surat, turquoise from Tibet, lapis lazuli from Afghanistan, tiger eyes from Sri Lanka, pankhuni from Balkh, sangmusa from Jaipur, summog from Arabia, Khattu from Jaisalmer, Surkh from Panna, Ghar from Jabalpur, Magnatis from Jabalpur, Pai zahar from Gwalior, sangmarmar from Makrana. But what catches your eyes as you walk through the gates is the sangmarmar or the marble structure that took 17 years to build. To your left from the gala entrance is the toilet, where you will have to pay Rs 5 if you are an India and they won't give any receipt (environment friendly?)."
30,Tajmahal,Amazing - exceeds expectations,"We visited at sunset and at sunrise. ""Sunrise"" was spoiled somewhat by the gates staying closed until well after sunrise. Beautiful and serene even with the crowds. Worth hiring a good guide."
50,Tajmahal,What an amazing place,"We wanted to visit the Taj Mahal whilst we were in India and we were not disappointed! This is one of those places that exceeds your expectations. It's so beautiful, the architecture is so interesting and it is an amazing monument to love. We used a guide recommended by our driver, the guide was Rahul Singh Rajawat. He was a lovely man, very knowledgeable and polite,. He kept all the hawkers at bay and helped us to take some fabulous photos to remember our day. I can recommend the Taj and the guide to anyone visiting India."
50,Tajmahal,Photographs cannot do this justice,I think we were fortunate to have visited the Taj Mahal now as I believe in years to come it will be restricted to exterior view only. Already you are not allowed to go down into the tomb area.
50,Tajmahal,WORTH THE VISIT,"We did the right thing by (1) hiring a tour guide at the ticket office and (2) hiring a photographer also. Enjoyed the 10 minute horse drawn rickshaw to the entrance of the Taj Mahal fortress...Highly recommend you start your journey that way... The tour guide was able to move us through the crowds effectively and shared insights we would not have otherwise known. TIP: PLAN TO ARRIVE AS AS SOON AS IT OPENS: IT IS *HOT* and *CROWDED*. LARGE BAGS and FOOD is not allowed on the property, TRAVEL LIGHT."
50,Tajmahal,Absolutely breathtaking!,We traveled as a group with a friend who is from India. I would recommend finding a guide so that you can have a better understanding of the area & why it was built. I would also recommend going as early as you can in the morning especially during their hot seasons as it becomes brutal in the afternoon.  This place is s photographers dream! The gardens surrounding the area are beautiful as are the ornate designs within the Taj itself.
50,Tajmahal,Early morning start was what made it all the more beautiful,"Awesome is the feeling you get when you last eyes on the magnificent structure for the first time. However, the chaotic prices of entry takes away the excitement a little bit. But a must do if you are ever visiting Agra..."
50,Tajmahal,Impressed,"Having seen so many photos over the years we thought we knew what to expect. Our expectations were more than met. Our guide, Sanjay Mudgal, suggested to go at sunrise to capture its full beauty and it did not disappoint. He moved to us around so that we could see the sun catch the inlaid pieces to see them glitter was incredible. With hundreds of people there it was still incredibly peaceful. Sanjay was incredibly knowledgable and explained everything clearly ."
50,Tajmahal,Literally breathtaking!,I was expecting to be underwhelmed by the Taj Mahal but the first glimpse of it through the archway of the gate bought a lump to my throat. And this was despite the fact that two of the minarets were shrouded in scaffolding and the fountains had been emptied. One of the highlights of our month-long trip to India.
50,Tajmahal,Beats all imagination and expectations,"The Beauty of Taj was overwhelming and beyond what i had imagined or read about. The history, architecture is fascinating.  It deserves the title - Wonder of World !!"
50,Tajmahal,stunning,I was so interested to find out things I did not know about the Taj Mahal. It was a wonderful trip and a bucket list item.
50,Tajmahal,Amazing and not to be missed.,"Arrived early (still dark). Queued for short time at gates . Security check as you enter. Such a tranquil, elegant building in the early morning light. Steady stream of tourists so impossible to photograph whole building without other people in the shot. Towers with scaffolding while we were there so not as unspoilt as we would have liked. Told they were cleaning. Few restrictions so able to walk around the area freely. Covers on shoes supplied when entering the main building. Was hassled by a man who insisted on showing us best places for photographs. ( He was helpful but very persistent). Although busy it never felt crowded and the atmosphere was relaxed. Will never forget the exquisite craftsmanship and overall beauty of the buildings."
50,Tajmahal,Lived up to expectations,"Wonderful visit to this iconic building, Professional photographer on standby should you wish to partake."
50,Tajmahal,Surely it is a one of 7 wonder of the world,Loved to see Taj Mahala and feel proud that it is build by Indians. River view is great from there. Must visit for all.
50,Tajmahal,Awesome,"Awesome it is. We were earlier reluctant to do Photographer and guide, but doing them was the best decision. Negotiate the rates of their services and don't buy any stuff if they take you to any shop. They were good because they clicked superb photograph and told the significance and history of taj mahal"
50,Tajmahal,magificent,"Simply magnificent! Looking at the Taj Mahal and thinking of how it was built, I was overwhelmed with emotions."
50,Tajmahal,A Must See!,"Amidst the squalor and chaos of the surrounding area this place is a cool, clean gem! Once you get through the hoards of pedlars (it really is nerve wracking!) it's lovely and peaceful! I'll never understand the whole ""one line for men, one line for women"" idea of entry at India's attractions (and airports) though."
50,Tajmahal,A MUST DO!!!,"The Taj Mahal is the most understated attraction. nothing in photos compares to the real thing, i could gaze at it for hours in wonder!! I suggest going at sunset or sunrise to get the gorgeous orange colour-but sunrise there are less people around. Also try to go on a clear day"
50,Tajmahal,Better in real life,"This is world famous, but nothing prepares you for the scale and beauty of the place.  Best at sunset when the embedded jewels in the marble start to sparkle!"
50,Tajmahal,Must see,"Very lucky not having to queue to get in (10am on a Thursday) but expect big queues as most visited site in India. Security searched - not allowed any sharp objects. Tickets 750 rupees for foreigners. Good access right up to, and inside the building - you can really see the exquisite detail up close, and walk round the building for views across the river."
50,Tajmahal,Wonderful Wonder of the World,"We have spend very good time at Taj in the morning. It's the best time to view this beauty. To our surprise, there were more foreigners then Indians in the morning time. Kids love to see the Taj so closely. Ultimately very nice experience at this wonder of the World.  CA. Anil Goel"
50,Tajmahal,Picnic,Tajmahal is great feeling of love Once time in life Visit tajmahal Trip adviser is very helpful for journey
50,Tajmahal,Cant take my eyes of Taj Mahal.,"It really worth the trip. Taj Mahal is magnificent and I dont mind to come back again and feel the beauty of Taj. Its a short trip ,. We went on Saturday early morning from Puna, direct flight to New Delhi. And car from the travel agent pick us up and took us directly to the hotel. A guide also provided , he told us about the story of Taj Mahal, but I just dont care to listen all stories just walk left him behind try to get inside the Taj as fast as possible. How they crafted all the marbles are amazing. I went with 9 years and 4 years kids, though we all woke up by 2,30 am to go to the airport they can enjoyed the trip to Taj and walk alots. We spend almost 3 hours there, taking too many pics, adoring the marbles.  They have also toilet, and water pipe to drink but I prefer to bring my water bottle. They have a special locket and fee for foreigner and local. A small museum you can see a sword, pics, not so many things but its ok to see as you already inside the complex.  Tips: Choose February or January as the weather also cool. No need to wear a sweater as the sun still there, And you need to walk a lots, bring water bottles, especially if you go with kids, hat and sunglasses.  Dont bring lipstick or pen, as they will check your bag and took them.  Dont buy the Taj souvenir from the seller in front of Taj as its not pure marble.  Many ppl selling the book about history of Taj outside the complex, I want to buy one but too crowded around us make me not so mood to talk to one of them.  If you dont want to hire a photografer from the complex dont even think to talk to one of them as he will follow you all the time.  I love Taj Mahal."
50,Tajmahal,Met our lofty expectations!,"Our 5 point review: 1) Often, expectations exceed the reality of a sight, not so for the Taj Mahal - with our expectations so high that we thought for sure it could not be met, we were happily surprised and satisfied 2) A lot of tourists (as expected) during the sunset hours, but it was well worth the bit of squeeze and we found that with a little patience, you could get the wonderful pictures you needed 3) Going up to the Taj Mahal, there are two lines, one for foreign tourists and the other for locals. Depending on which you are, you may want to check as the line when we were there for locals was wrapped around the building while that for foreign tourists was very short - almost immediate access 4) The beauty of the Taj Mahal is difficult to describe. ""A teardrop on the cheek of eternity"" may be the best description as it is the monument of love to Shah Jahan's wife Mumtaz Mahal 5) Honestly inspiring, not only for the beauty of its construction, the detailing in the precious stone-inlaid white marble, but also for the story behind the construction. Truly beautiful and a world wonder!"
50,Tajmahal,stunning taj mahal,"really impressive, awesome n masterpiece of stones sculpture. visited last Friday after holi found worth visiting once in lifetime just to mark your presence"
50,Tajmahal,Love it,A nice love story ended with a beautiful building it is a dream true moment really love it.i think to see it again and again with my sweet wife and children's specially sunrise is very nice caz not so many people it is good to be the first one to enter button to hard caz always some people are there to do the same.
50,Tajmahal,Beautiful place,"Actually, It was romantic place if you know the story.. The building it self made by white marble from italy."
50,Tajmahal,Magestic!,"We went at both sunset and sunrise. Was surprised that the number of tourists was so high, for both timings, but the place is so truly stunning"
50,Tajmahal,Always impressive,"We live in Delhi, and visit the Taj Mahal whenever we have friends and family visiting from abroad. I never get tired of looking at this mesmerizing building."
50,Tajmahal,Once in a lifetine experience,There are 2 kinds of people in the world. The first type are the ones who have not seen the Taj Mahal. The second types are the ones who have seen this wonder of the world.
50,Tajmahal,Made the trip!!,What a fantastic trip! It was well worth seeing especially at sunrise. It's majestic and glorious. The surrounding area is calm and you can relax in the shade of the Taj Mahal
50,Tajmahal,No picture could ever do this place justice,Absolutely magnificent and should be on everyone's bucket list. The place is magical but very busy. I wouldn't do the official photography on offer as our photos were much better than theirs so save yourself this expense unless you just buy 1/2. We bought an album with CD and it isn't worth it.
50,Tajmahal,Bucket list experience:),"Visiting the Taj Mahal has been on my bucket list for more than a decade. It was amazing. Recommend planning a day trip from Delhi and combining the trip with the Agra Fort and surrounding area. If I were to go again, I might stay overnight to further explore the surrounding area. Take in the entire place... the gardens, the surrounding buildings, the Taj itself. We used a travel agent that helped us navigate entry, including tickets + sorting out the electric vehicle ride into the Taj area + getting our shoe covers for entering the tomb area. Wear comfortable clothes / shoes; bring water + camera. Beware of pick pockets when you visit the tombs and also of people taking photos for money. The Taj has been under repair / restoration. There was some scaffolding up around two of the towers, but didn't take away from the experience."
50,Tajmahal,Our sunrise tour at the Taj Mahal,"We used getyourguide.com and had booked our trip before leaving the U.K. We had a fantastic guide named Aman from Maria Tours. From start to finish everything was exactly as planned. Our guide made the trip, as his knowledge on the history of the Taj Mahal was fantastic. He also took lots of pictures for us on our camera, as he knew the best positions and angles. This was the perfect ending to our 3 week tour of India. ,"
50,Tajmahal,I know how to skip the queue!,"We arrived to Taj at 5.30 in the morning, East gate, as it was said this gate had less people. In the ticket office there were about 20 people queueing and waiting the ticket desk to be open. In 20 minutes the guide we booked in advance arrived, went straight to the window for indians and got 2 tickets for us without any queue. Cool. The same happened at the entrance. He took us straight to the security aside of the queue, which was like 100 people already. I don't know whether all official guide can do this? As at the Agra fort he said we wouldn't be queueing and being searched as security knows him very well. Anyway, we got in and caught these wonderful moments of sun rising and colour changing. A bit dissapointed with the amount of people though:) BTW our guide name was narendra gupta, you can easily google him as agra guide. Attention to photographers: tripods are forbidden. Attention to families with children: cuddly toys are not allowed."
50,Tajmahal,Masterpiece...!!,"Start early to enjoy the real beauty to escape the long queues as every one wants to be at this place. Rabindranath Tagore described it as ""the tear-drop on the cheek of time"" which is quite true. The Taj Mahal incorporates and expands on design traditions of Persian and earlier Mughal architecture, magnificent isn't it?"
50,Tajmahal,Maybe not to all but awesome to me!,"A fantastic building quite unlike any other. Will always be worth a visit, even more so if the grounds were better maintained."
50,Tajmahal,Must visit place in India.,If you have been in India and not visited the Taj Mahal then your visit is incomplete. The structure of 17th century you cannot compare with anything.
50,Tajmahal,Symbol Of Love,I am Iranian and I felt proud that this building is the symbol of love for an iranian woman.i really felt the positive energy in the place.
50,Tajmahal,The Monument of Love,"I will not review the place itself as everyone is familiar with the Taj Mahal...Instead, I will advice travelers to visit early in the morning as huge queues can be avoided and thus a more enjoyable experience of the Taj Mahal can be achieved by reaching the place at the right time....."
50,Tajmahal,"Taj Mahal, a true Wonder","It is hard to say anything about the Taj Mahal that has not been said. It lives up to the hype. Towering, majestic, and so detailed. I suggest finding a guide, as there is so much history that we would have missed had we walked through on our own. I also suggest being ready for a massive human traffic jam when you enter the Taj Mahal mausoleum. And watch your pockets there! A must see if you are anywhere near Agra!!"
50,Tajmahal,Wonderful place,Taj Mahal is wonderful place. Must visit. Very good architecture. Very good garden and good cleaning. Taj Mahal is one of the best wonder of the world. Amazing place.
50,Tajmahal,"One word, Mesmerised!!","What a beautiful structure is it, can keep staring at it the entire day. So our and serene that it penetrates deep into your soul. No wonder why is it one of the wonders on earth. The more you go closer and more you discover. It's different from angles. The view of adjacent Jamuna was enchanting. From wherever in the city, just a glimpse of it would make your day. Also visited Taj during moonlight and was a different experience altogether. Must see places at least once in a life time."
50,Tajmahal,Sunrise Tour of Taj Mahal,"Definitely go at sunrise! No crowds at all. Beautiful place, a must see if ever in India. Arrange tour in advance..."
50,Tajmahal,Meets expectations,"It doesn't matter how many times people tell you how beautiful the Taj Mahal is, you are still stunned when you get to see it in person. What a masterpiece!!! Do not miss."
50,Tajmahal,Awesome lifetime experience! A must see!,It really is one of the world's seven wonders! Photos I've seen do not do it justice....highly recommend anyone seeing it once in their lifetime.
50,Tajmahal,The Most Amazing Piece of Architecture I've Seen,"We've all heard about the Taj Mahal and have seen images but nothing is comparable to the moment you enter and see it in person for the first time. I nearly cried lol. It's hard to explain why it's so magnificent and all I can say is that it's a must see and definitely bucket list worthy. It's definitely worthy of it's title as one of the wonders of the world. They symmetry is just breathtaking (and I'm an asymmetric kinda guy). If love had a tangible symbol, this is definitely it!  Some tips:  - We waited for the early morning crowd to enter and by the time we got there on a Saturday morning (about 8am), we walked right it.  - Hire Ash (Ashutosh Sharma) as your guide (search him on trip advisor)  - You can bring a small bag but it will be subject to search which may take longer to enter, though when we went, that line was not busy either  - You can ""hire"" a photographer by the entrance who will take photos for you and at the end you can buy the printed copies. I'm a professional photographer but the friends I was traveling with wanted to do it just for fun/souvenirs. It's pretty cheap and they get all the funny touristy shots for you. He was cool enough to grab my camera and work his way to the center to grab a shot for me.  - I was thinking it was going to be crazy to try and grab a photo dead center, but it really wasn't that bad. We were there in March of 2016 and we had heard that tourism was hurting a little so that could be why it wasn't as hectic as I was expecting.  - No photos allowed inside the tomb though you can just carry your camera with you  - You'll need shoe covers to get close to and enter the Taj (provided by our tour guide)  - Take a minute to just soak it in after all the mayhem of trying to get the shot. Sit by a tree, stair and relax. You'll probably never see it again.  - When you exit the Taj main gate, walk out towards the left and you'll see this hallway with this really cool orange walk way. A really cool photo opportunity, the orange in India is the best (see photos)"
50,Tajmahal,Just fascinating,"Just magical, if you are going to visit the Taj Mahal then go soon as they are going to cover the whole of the building in scaffolding"
50,Tajmahal,Wah Taj,Visited Taj Mahal and find it an amazing piece of architect and human love and devotion. Every person should visit taj mahal atleast once in his life to appreciate the beauty and human efforts gone in it to make it. Overall a worth visit place . Try to avoid visiting during holidays or during cooler climate as its gets very crowded during that period.
50,Tajmahal,Seeing is believing!,"You shall not skip the Taj when you're in Agra! It's the best monument i've seen in my life! I had a guide with me and upon hearing the history behind it, you kinda appreciate it more. The craftsmanship of this monument is close to perfect. The engravings were immaculate and the whole place was generally pretty clean. I went there on a Sunday morning to catch the sunrise. There were a lot of visitors but not too overwhelming. You should avoid weekends morning. This is perfect to visit in winter (the guide said Dec/Jan is the perfect time). India in general is hot during summer (temp can go up to 50 deg!) so avoid those months. I will definitely visit the Taj again with another group of companions so that i can relive the moment again."
50,Tajmahal,Breathtaking Monument,"When you go to Agra, with the intention of visiting the Taj make sure you start early, waiting will subject you to long lines. Also don't bring a purse or back pack when you go through security you can't bring makeup of any sort and other miscellaneous items so leave them in the hotel. When enter the grounds you will be greeted by dogs on the side, resting and a heap of monkeys jumping from place to place, don't wear or have shiny objects on you. Once you past the first wine colored building your eyes get adjusted and then there in its majestic shiny marble, the Taj Mahal comes into view. The gardens around are beautiful, just be careful where you step since some elevations have a mini drop. There will be photographers taking pictures again negotiate, but yes worth it. Inside the building you put on special feet protector since you can't walk on your soles of your shoes. This is why you want to come early everyone wants to get inside, and it starts to resemble Grand Central at five in the afternoon. Take your time look at the floors, walls each etching is different and unique, your looking at someone's expression of love to his soul mate, romantic with dripping of morbidity. You won't be able to just take a couple of pictures, again in the morning the lighting is perfect for pictures. Also bring a bottle of water the sun around mid day can be hot."
50,Tajmahal,An Outstanding Architecture - Gifted to this world by an Emperor of Love,"An Outstanding Architecture - Gifted to this world by an Emperor of Love, who tried to be equally at his best to be an outstanding mathematician & an outstanding scientist. Though I don't have flawless eyes, but if the theory of symmetry or the mechanism of shock-absorbing abilities by wooden logs/planks inside 40wells dug beneath the entire structure to protect the monument from earthquakes, are facts, then considering the year of it's build-up, it is definitely one of the phenomenal artistry on earth. A must-see Amazing Monument for All atleast once in his/her lifetime."
50,Tajmahal,Simple beautiful.,"An amazing building. Absolutely beautiful and well worth the price. Although it is quite pricey in comparison to the rest of India, this is an amazing landmark and I found it breathtaking. We had a lovely tour guide who we took out for lunch afterwards! And it all just added to the experience. However I would recommend taking a day trip to the Taj from Delhi, as the rest of Agra isn't much to look at!"
50,Tajmahal,7th wonder of the world,"Pros. 1. It is the 7th wonder of the world 2. Well maintained Cons 1. Lack of adequate cleanliness & infrastructure 2. Hugh amount of foot falls daily, so lots of people/crowd"
50,Tajmahal,Amazing,Lost for words..beautiful place....had an amazing time...taj mahal.what a creation..the history..the marble..stone..the fort..atmosphere...so clever how they built it in those days without any modern technology
50,Tajmahal,The most outstandingly attractive monument in the entire world!,"This is perhaps my fourth visit, and frankly i wondered if the repition may make it a mundane experience. Also i had caught glimses from my hotel and from the nearby Tajnature walk. But the visit again renderedme breathless. As a US president once said: there are two kinds of people in the world- those tgat have seen the Taj, and those that havent. Grateful that i am in the former category. Amazing experience/ highly recommended."
50,Tajmahal,Simply Iconic,"So much is written of the supposedly most photographed building on the planet, so I'll just try to fill a few gaps and upload some interesting photos. One thing we didn't know is that the emperor who built this masterpiece lived in Agra Fort, which is visible from the Taj, with his concubines. Suppose that was one of the perks of power, as well as getting the myriad of gemstones ground to perfection by an army of workers which adorn the white marble. Also, the view back to the entry building is overlooked. Wishing you success in your quest to check this one off your ""bucket list"". PS If you look like a local you'll get in for a fraction of the cost."
50,Tajmahal,Breathtaking,Early morning is good - watch out for mossies though while waiting to get in. Nothing prepares you for this sight no matter how many times you se it on TV or magazines. The 007 film Octopussy features the Taj Mahal from the Ref Fort - great reminder of a wonderful visit.
50,Tajmahal,Love never die,"I belong to Agra but never been to Taj Mahal before my this visit. After my visit to Taj Mahal I was shocked , I got the view which was only in my dreams. Really touching beauty of Taj. I recommend to visit Tajmahal in morning."
50,Tajmahal,Amazing,The most beautiful building in the world. It was an amazing experience to go see the Taj. We went for sunrise and it was amazing with the light. Not to busy and so nice to walk around with not to much people. Don't miss this place even if it's expensive.
50,Tajmahal,A Must-See in India,"The Taj Mahal is a stunning display of love and architecture. Closed on Fridays. Go around 5 pm to see it glow in that glorious afternoon Indian sunlight. It is scaffolded currently for cleaning but it's necessary work and the before-and-after is quite amazing. Don't stop for the hawkers on the way in and out. They're aggressive and persistent. The horse-drawn carriage ride to and from the gate is not worth it either. Learn to spot the difference between marble and soapstone/limestone, and save yourself making bad purchases. As a tour operator, I've been to the Taj Mahal many times and have never been disappointed. A magical place."
50,Tajmahal,Most amazing monument,"Amazing experience. To reach Taj, first you have to go through a portal, that initially you can´t see what´s on the other side, but as you advance further, the monument begins to reveal itself. Just can´t describe the feeling!!!!"
50,Tajmahal,One of the wonders of the architect world,Amazing architectural burial site for kings wife. Beautiful marble. It is a quick walk through of the actual building but the whole area is filled with great history.
40,Tajmahal,A memorable site,"The site was very lovely. It was clean and well maintained, which was a welcome change from the streets of Agra. The gardens were beautiful also. This was a striking monument from a husband to his wife. Though they were cleaning 3 out of the 4 pillars, it was still lovely to see."
40,Tajmahal,Magnificent!!!!,one of the new 7 wonders of the world. all made of marble. it was really beautiful and I was amazed to see that huge awesomeness in a building. the queues are veryyyyy long but don;t worry. if you're a tourist and coming from outside of india the queue isn't long for you and you will get there in no time. there isn't anything special inside Taj Mahal but it's really picturesque from the outside and you can take thousands of photos with lots of different poses. have fun
40,Tajmahal,A stunning piece of Architecture,"This is an amazing place, but to my surprise it is quite noisy inside. Ear plugs might be a good idea! but the intercate inlaid marble is just stunning as are the views."
40,Tajmahal,Amazing!,"Taj Mahal was a bucket list place for me and it's beauty was well worth it! Only complaint for me was that it was holly wknd so the crowds were insane. The line to get in was hectic and exhausting with people pushing and shoving. Therefore, some improvement in service for ticket entrance would be helpful! Our tour guide was wonderful and the taj really is beautiful so it was definitely worth the hassle."
40,Tajmahal,"Stunning views from afar, don't pay for a guide","From a distance the Taj Mahal is exactly as stunning as you expect it to be, and there's a moment when you walk in when you can see a peek of the Taj through one of the entrances which made me very excited.  Don't pay for a guide unless you really want to learn some facts... They try to tell you that it will be very crowded and they'll get you priority access without queueing - foreigners have to pay more and get faster access anyway.  There are a couple of negatives but nothing to stop anyone visiting... You're not allowed to wear shoes inside the building (unless they're covered) so when you get up close there are shoe covers everywhere, it was unbelievably crowded inside the building, it was very hard to get a free bus from the ticket office to the entrance (we ended up paying for a tuk tuk)"
40,Tajmahal,Taj in a Saree/Sari,"-Go early -Do NOT bring snacks, juice gum etc etc etc they will take it when they scan your handbag -get your ticket first -get in the correct line -if you take a rickshaw to the entry gate from ticket sales 50IND is enough -wear a comfortable flattering outfit, even if you don't like getting/taking photos you'll be lured in by the fabulous backdrop of the Taj--I bought and wore a Sari for some fabulous photos -DO negotiate how much you'd pay for a set amount of photos BEFORE someone starts trying to take them of you -you'll get them afterwards outside the gate as a disk snd prints, maybe 10 prints is enough for a couple people I got ripped off so I don't know how much you should pay - be patient for good photos and enjoy the experience -great sunset views from the moon garden across the river (if you want to see if a roam free from a distance without a long queue plus the garden actually smells great from all the jasmine and assorted flowers)"
40,Tajmahal,visit to monument of love,visited agra with my family to show the kids the splendor of Taj Mahal. However over the year it has lost its sheen...literally. The monument was teeming with people which is however not surprising living in India. The Taj was undergoing repair etc so there was scaffolding in three of the minarets which made it less adorable. But the grandness and surreal beauty was what i was looking at. Go ahead and pose with the Taj in background. The monument requires maintenance and look-up..this is a real issue. Overall a satisfying experience and would recommend everybody to visit at least once in lifetime
40,Tajmahal,Amazing place but troublesome to reach,Huge and amazing place.  A bit difficult to reach. The place was so crowded. People were crawling like insects as it was a weekend.  Had to bribe a guy to get us in as the queue for tickets was about 500 meters long in sun.  After the entry the place is good but people should visit on weekdays preferably otherwise you would be pushed around by the crowd.
40,Tajmahal,Must see in Agra,"If you are in Agra it is likely to see the Taj Mahal anyhow, but it deserves a review. If you are a tourist, be aware of 'locals' asking for your photo then mobbing you and trying to take things--this is a known scam throughout the world but be aware. Amazing site and even better with a guide who can show you subtle interesting facts about the architecture and building. If it is summer hold your breath when you go inside, not a great aroma from all the sweating ppl but still a must see :)"
40,Tajmahal,Worth the visit but not as spiritual as other palaces in india,"100% worth the visit if you are in India, please note however that entry is now 750 rupees for foreigners and the minarets are currently covered in scaffolding which somewhat spoils your pictures."
40,Tajmahal,"Great photos, majestic!","Woke up so early to do the sunrise photo opportunity tour. Never made it in time. Seems no one has ever made it in time to purchase the tickets, travel to the site, and make through security in time. The actual Taj Mahal isn't as big as one would think; but the photos are purely majestic! Go to a roof top cafe/restaurant after your visit and enjoy the views!"
40,Tajmahal,"""Good experience""",This is a beautiful place to visit but it has become so commercialized and crowded it is hard to get around. It is still a wonderful place to visit if you are ever lucky enough to visit that area of India. But the entrance fee is very high.best time to go there is for sunrise.
40,Tajmahal,Must visit,"I visited Agra with my family in March. Though it was quite hot but we went in the evening and stayed for few hours. It was totally worth it. You should either go in the morning or evening to stay away from heat.  There is restoration going on and most of the Taj Mahal has turned yellowish in color and needs cleaning. It will take a good 10+ years.  Still, a must visit!!"
40,Tajmahal,"Dramatic, and more than just the Taj","The animals on the way to the Taj are NOT all looked after well. Many lame and emaciated horses work the 1km tourist run, which in this day and age is a total disgrace! ( the animals around Agra are in the worst condition by far of any we saw on our 3 week tour of India). PLEASE DO NOT SUPPORT THESE TRADERS IF THE HORSE IS LAME OR IN POOR CONDITION! ( bones sticking through frame, dull coat with sad, disinterested disposition ) Do not be lulled by flowers and fancy paintwork on the carriages! There are also many stray emaciated flea ridden dogs. At the enterance, expect to cue to get in to the Taj, pre booking advised. Lots of wildlife in the gardens, there are plenty of owls and squirrels as well as eagles and other critters, ( if you know where to look). On weekends the lakes are drained for cleaning, then re filled late Sunday for mid week. We saw them dry ( and later being re filled, though they didn't look as though they'd been cleaned!) Yes, the Taj is dramatic, the workmanship is an increadible sight, and if the weather gives you the ideal lighting its even better. Loads of pesky tourists ( wonder why? ;-) ) Go to the rest room BEFORE going to the Taj, as that is not the best tourist aspect here!"
40,Tajmahal,One of the must visits when in India,"Great experience, marvelous monument, politely avoid taking any Guides and photographers like a plague."
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful,"just fabulous monument. Too bad the Indians do not always respect this place and keep asking us (or not) to get take pictures with them. With so many crowds, this is exhausting! Prefer maybe a visit early in the morning at 11am because it's really crazy!"
40,Tajmahal,World's wonder,"After being in line for almost an hour, I really hoped the wait was worth it. And here I was entering the white wonder.  The view of Taj Mahal is breath taking. You set your eyes for the first time and it makes you fall in love. Unfortunately, Taj Mahal was being cleaned so couldn't get the perfect pic. But whatever we saw was worth the wait. Though it would be better if you can visit Tajmahal during spring or winters as it's very hot there. And avoid weekend as you may end up spending your time in a queque.  Enjoy!!"
40,Tajmahal,One of those thing I thought I'd only ever see on TV,"To visit the Taj was one of those things on the 'bucket list' and something as a kid I never thought would be something I would do.  It was therefore a wonderful experience to visit such an amazing, majestic and renowned place.  Although on our visit the weather wasn't amazing, there was works ongoing to clean the towers and it was busy, you still had that sense of being alone and able to be at peace and tranquillity.  This was definitely one of the highlights of all my trips throughout the world!"
40,Tajmahal,Nice views,"We went there in the morning from the west gate. On our way in there were a lot of people who wanted us to hire then as a guide, we didn't and we're glad because it turnéns out that a guide is included in the 750 INR per person fee, you also get a bottle of water and shoecovers.  Our guide also took a lot of pictures of us, we saw a lot of people hiring the photografers to do the exact same thing our guide did for free.  He also told us to hold on to our tickets for the red fort to get a discount."
40,Tajmahal,"Taj is great, but the touts and louts horrible!","After you pay 750 rupees to enter, there is a no form of transportation to get to the taj - about a mile away. Well, yes a few rickety busses make unscheduled stops at random. There is no system of lining up or even a sign to suggest where the bus is to be taken? People jostle and fight to get into the bus. On our way in, a couple of German tourists, abused my wife and elbowed their way in. But, can you blame them? We had to be aggressive as well, otherwise we would still be waiting for the bus! Outside the taj, the touts are horribly aggressive and will skin you alive, given the chance. Out three teenage companions from canada were prime target and it was difficult to ""protect"" them. I wish the government had a better handle on controlling the mobsters. Horrible!"
40,Tajmahal,Beautiful and thought provoking,"What can one say about the Tak Mahal. It is a beautiful monument to love. It is not to be missed if you are visiting India. It is beautiful in the late afternoon/evening. As it closes at 6pm, try to get there for 4-5pm. It can get crowded so choose your day carefully. As a foreign tourist, your entrance fee is higher than locals but that allows you to take a shorter queue so make us of that. Also, I understand that when dignitaries visit, they close the whole place down so make sure you know when the great and good are visiting and avoid going there.The inside of the Taj Mahal is as beautiful as outside with ornate marble work. Take a torch and shine it right up against the marble wall - you will see that the marble is transparent. I found it very thought provoking as although it is a monument to love, the number of people and cost it took to build this was rather disproportionate given the poverty in the country."
40,Tajmahal,A beautiful place,This is a beautiful place to visit but it has become so commercialized and crowded it is hard to get around. I was there in 1997 and again a couple of weeks ago and it was not near as nice as the first time. It is still a wonderful place to visit if you are ever lucky enough to visit that area of India.
40,Tajmahal,A once in a lifetime place,"We stayed at the Oberoi so getting there is very ease, a buggy straight to the gate with no real queues. Take a hotel guide its worth the money as they will explain everything, You will probably need an hour here, onceinside there is not a great deal to see. Would I return ? No, Ithink its a one off visit"
40,Tajmahal,Renovation these days,"The monument is under renovation these days and many part are not accessible to tourists. If possible, see this monument in moon light (that's possible for only 12-13 times every year!"
40,Tajmahal,Great Monument,The place is awesome and the architecture is great. maintenance is excellent. Its worth a visit anytime
40,Tajmahal,Picture Square,"It's a place where you can sit peacefully and propose your girlfriend, or else you can fall in love with your life partner again!"
40,Tajmahal,Fabulous,Had the chance of being accompanied by a very good guide Kamil. He explained every details about the Taj Mahal and we really enjoyed there.
40,Tajmahal,"Wonderful, but currently under construction","I went to the Taj Mahal on March 17, 2016 and while it was a spectacular sight to see, 3 of the 4 minarets were under scaffolding which naturally reduced the picturesque nature of the attraction. Views from the Agra Fort were slightly less affected due to the distance (see pictures).  The easiest way to get tickets for entry at the Taj Mahal are at the ""Shilpgram"" east gate ticket building. Yes, foreigners pay more (750 INR) than locals (20 INR), but you get some free bottles of water. From Shilpgram to the Taj Mahal entrance, it is several hundred meters, so you will need to walk or take a bicycle taxi (there are many of them waiting in the parking lot; I used ""Johnny #2"").  If you can, time your visit to arrive after renovation work is completed, but it is still amazing, even under construction."
30,Tajmahal,Disappointing,"Perhaps it was the scaffolding that was on the towers around the Taj that spoiled it for us. But no it was the more that the maintenance and crowd control just took away the magic. The Taj is a tourist circus. Starting from witnessing the sad lame horses that ferried oblivious visitors to its gates, to the heavy iron bar cattle channels you are ferried into to get through the doors. Once inside the Taj there is a mass of humanity. You can hardly take a photo as there are just so many people. There was no water in the famous streams in front of the Taj so no chance of the famous reflection. There was however a sleeping dog, (I checked and he was alive) and this actually was the best thing about our visit as it made us smile. Whoever is responsible for the day to day running of this wonderful place needs a serious policy review. The gardens and ornamental (empty) waterways are full of plastic bottles and other garbage. Getting closer to the Taj the throng of people gets more intense. The queues were horrendous. We spotted a sign which said fast track for expensive ticket which we did not have but we took anyway and we got to the front quickly. Inside the mausoleum there is nothing to see!!! Even though people were queing for hours. You just go around it like a merrygoround of compacted people and all you see is the stone interior of the dome. It was actually a very sad visit for us for something we had dreamed about seeing all our lives. We were due to spend 2 days in Agra and visit the Taj several times but we cut our stay short. We did visit Agra Fort on our way out of town and this place is amazing and the view of the Taj is magical. Sad as it is I would say dont go out of your way to visit teh Taj there are far better places to go. The the town of Agra is really not very nice, with nowhere to go apart from the Taj."
30,Tajmahal,Looks majestic from far away,"The Taj Mahal looked so majestic from far away but as you approach, you notice that it is in a very bad state. Restoration work was going on so hopefully this will no longer be the case. If the queue is too long, you can skip going inside; it just has 2 tombs.  Due to the restoration work we could not get perfect photos. Also I believe that the entry fee is too high for tourists, it is INR 750 compared to INR 20 for locals."
30,Tajmahal,Overhyped?,"My visit to the Taj Mahal was meh. However I learned a few things which might make it better for you.  Be aware - the price jumped April 1st, 2016 to 1250 rupees (up from 750 rupees).  Tip 1. Go at sunrise. After speaking to others who did this, I think it's the optimum time to visit. Less people and the sun rising and changing its color was ""magical."" I tried at sunset but the magic didn't happen as the sun didn't set behind the temple but alongside it.  2. Pay for a guide or download an app that will explain the Taj Mahal and its history. This will def give you a much better experience guaranteed.  3. If the lines are too long to go inside, don't bother. There's not much to see and it's really cramped. The two tombs are replicas created by the man's daughter. The real tombs are located 20' below out of sight.  4. If the fee is too high, go to the garden across the river from the Taj Mahal. It may be the backside but it's still a nice view. You could also visit the ""baby Taj Mahal."" We had planned to but there was a communication breakdown w/our tuk tuk driver.  Finally I'd also recommend visiting the fort and again, hiring a guide or download an app. I had a phenomenal guide; he gave me his card which is around here somewhere. If you want his info, send me a msg. He was worth all 250 rupees, even for a backpacker like myself! Seeing both allows the story line to be complete."
30,Tajmahal,Incredible to see,"Agra as a place is dirty, full of scams and not a friendly place to stay. My advise would be to visit the taj mahal on a day trip. Unfortunately I stayed for 4 days and in that time I was constantly hassled and racially abused. Shocking! I travelled India for nearly 3 months (north to south) and this was without a doubt the most unfriendly place I'd ever visited. Felt very uncomfortable walking around the town. I would go see the taj but get in and get out of Agra."
30,Tajmahal,Greedy city,"This city has a very agressive energy. Everybody wants you to just pass them your money, as they assume that you found yours on the street. And then you reach Taj Mahal, already tired, where a rude official yells on you why you gave him 1500 rupees when it's 2000 for 2 person. As you were supposed to know it, without any sign telling you that they raised the prices - today! And it's 5,58 a.m. The Taj is under construction so don't expect any mirror photos as there is no water anywhere, just dirty basins. Plus the scaffolds around the minarets. Not a good time for price raising.. Yes, it's a beautiful piece of art, but I'm wondering is it worthwhile.."
30,Tajmahal,Nice scene for one foto...,Really impresive outside...a bit dissapointing inside... Fun fact: tourists have to wear special covers on their shoes not to destroy/litter the marbles if the interior.... BUT pingeons fly and... litter inside!
30,Tajmahal,Taj Mahal.. Such a Beauty!,I have been dreaming to see Taj Mahal since I was a kid. The day has come! Here the beauty of Taj Mahal lays in front of my eyes.. Thank you Allah. We were amazed to see the marble and listened to the history of the Taj Mahal.
20,Tajmahal,Not special at all,"From a restaurant terrace we got amazing views of Taj Mahal, and we make awesome pictures. To go the inside the Taj was too expensive for foreign people, and we didn't feel nothing special visiting this moschee. Before we visited other moschees in other country and the feelings were amazing."
20,Tajmahal,Disappointed !!,"Taj Mahal is disappointing . It is dirty , narrow, cramped & stinks of urine . I visited on Saturday & it looked as if some election rally was going on. People every where , crazy queues , bawling babies, old men & women . it was chaos, but the ancient Indian rope trick works "" money"" give it to the agents and you can get tickets and easy entry . As you enter all you see is people , be careful lest you stamp on someone. All you do after that is walk & walk. There is no drinking water available inside, carry lot of water, wear a cap, wear comfortable shoes and get out fast. Do not eat any thing in & around the monument. Do not buy anything there , it's overpriced. Just get out and vanish."
20,Tajmahal,satisfactory,poor crowd management
10,Tajmahal,Sad to see how The Indian Government values such a pride of India,"The Taj Mahal in isolation from its surroundings is simply amazing and a marvel to see , but it's just sad how discusting the Indian Government values this treasure. From the time you enter there is local Indians waiting to rip you off , everyone seems to want to swindle a tourist. The camels that give you a ride are treated badly and are absolutely dirty their ridders also give you high prices at first but I recommend you bargain or just rather walk because the Tuk Tuk also want to rip you off. Then the locals selling stuff just want to rip you off ,then you encounter various camera mens that want to rip you off and then the best is the so called tour guides also another bunch of corrupted individuals that want to make a quick buck of you , they don't even know the facts behind this monument. Then the busyness is unbarerable. As a tourist I paid 750 ruppees per a ticket to enter and locals pay 20 ruppees to enter , what a rip from the Indian Government. I would recommend you rather visit another tourist attraction ."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Excellent Place,Boating is worthy. Price is on the higher side. Rs 240 per person for 1.5 hours of boating. Spotted few birds alone. Very calm and serene
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Walking safari,"Did the early morning walk out of the main tiger and large mammal spotting season. Saw lots of monkeys, deer, bison, colourful birds and many plants. Guides very knowledgeable. Beware the leaches which are a pain but you are provided with protection and they dust your shoes. Wear long trousers and good shoes. Great fun."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,So tranquil and beautiful,"Got to see wild elephants, deer and monkeys from the boat. Beautiful vistas to the hills in the distance."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great place to visit,"We went on the nature walk. A bus takes you from town.  You need to wear ""socks"" which are provided to protect you from the leeches in the forest, particularly after rain. No bother, we saw some but they were no trouble.  Then there's a bamboo raft ride across the lake. OK, you just need to be caref getting on and off. The wardens help you.  We learnt about the forest and saw some animals (two types if squirrels, several monkeys and a deer. No elephants or tigers though, although you could see evidence of them"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,FANTASTIC SAFARI,periyar wildlife sanctuary is must must visited place. reach by ar and enjoy boat ride by forest department.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Scenic,"This wild life sanctuary is quite well spread across the hilly terrain. Though its difficult to spot tigers, there are lot of bison seen here."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,"jep ride, boat ride",periyar willlife sanctuary located around kumily in thekkady is attractive place amongst travellers. enjoy jeep ride boat riade
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Best part of out trip,We took a “Nature Walk” with Shivaz and had such an amazing time. We trekked through the forest for almost 3 hours and saw a variety of animals including the giant squirrel and the black monkey. However the walk exceeded all of our expectations when we came across a mother elephant and her youngster deep in the forest. Shivaz led us to them and we watched them for some time. The highlight of our trip! You must wear long trousers and sealed shoes though as you will come across leeches if you do this walk but it is totally worth it.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,visit early 1st safari,"if u want to see the animal , all about luck still from the local info and our perswonal visit we can hardly find animal at riverbank early mrng and mrng atmspher also good. u all will enjoy 1st sfari start 6.45 am by bus twrd river . boat will start 7.30.am"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,90 Mins of exhilerating Boat ride,"Never miss the very safe 90mMins of boat ride organised by the Forest department itself, an amazing experience of wide expanse of water, with wind animals seen on the distant shores especially the bisons, deers and a host of quaint birds"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Must see location,"Find some time to visit the location, take the boating on the morning at the earliest Nice location to watch"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,very very osum with thekkady jeep safari,It was an astounding rough terrain experience..loved the trip..the driver was sharp in clarifying a considerable measure about the forest..saw a few creatures however early morning ride was somewhat hazy so was not ready to see the spots legitimately but rather by and large delighted in a lott
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,best place for family,We stayed for two nights at Abad green forest resort which was excellent and the overall experience was good..awsome!!
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Awesome morning views,"We are lucky to watch many animals especially herd of elephants, herd of deer, hours and different types of birds. Grab a boating for 7:30am , be at boat jetty on time. Try to get a seat on upper deck. Lake view is awesome and authorities are very helpful in clicking snaps or videos."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Anacondas waiting to swallow your purse,"We stayed for two nights at Abad green forest resort which was excellent and the overall experience was good but we were fooled and robbed at Elephant camp as we wanted to do a jungle safari and they offered us Gavi jungle jeep safari which started at 5.00 am in the morning. A guide or driver was sent from the camp with a jeep and we left and while on the way we drove through a jungle while the guide kept looking for animals and he didn't find any and around 08.15 we reached Gavi where the Kerela forest division gave us a brochure which read Gavi etc tourism and the activities included boating, trekking and cardamom plantation visit. The whole thing in actuality was Gavi eco tourism and not jungle jeep safari as it had nothing which was safari as the jeep drove along a carpeted road to Gavi viz jungle with small villages on the way and we never entered the actual forest for a safari. It was worthless and disappointing. Also we watched an evening show at Elephant camp which included magic show which was worthless, fountain show which was disappointing and only Kathakali, Kallari and Tribal dance was good. I would recommend Thekkady for Ayurvedic massage at Rangerwood which is the cheap and best in Kerela. Do boating in Periyar lake, watch Kathakali, Kalluri and tribal dance so one night in Thekkady is more than sufficient but please avoid any jungle safari."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good one,The place is good and the boating duration will be for 1.5 hours. But one needs to be lucky to find tigers and elephants. We can see Bisons and Sambar deers.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great superb place,It was truly amazing place. The boating experience was amazing and worth spending. I must say it is very beautiful lake and jungle.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,How Animals should be seen,"We took an early morning boat ride and were lucky enough to see, a leopard, elephant with a young calf, wild dogs, deer, water buffalo, and lots of birds. This is way better than seeing them at places that sell elephant rides or where you pay to wash chained elephants in a river. These animals should be seen like this , in their own environment."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,good place to visit but do not expect to see any animal,"Animals are rarely seen here expect too many monkeys, beware of monkey here, so if possible travel with less/no hand bags"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Different and unique,"As compared to other wildlife sanctuaries, this one is different. Periyar national park is huge and scattered over a large area. Periyar lake passes through the forest and its surrounded by lush green grasslands. There are a lot of birds and animals around which can be seen around the lake."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,average,"not very interesting. after going through the hustle of parking away and catching a bus, through queues and the boat, we hardly saw any animals except for two bisons."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Expect Landscape and herds of herbivores. Remote chance of spotting larger mammals.,"For photographers, I would suggest two specific points.  1. Try to convince the seat allotment officers at the jetty to give you a seat on the top deck of the boat. The deck below has very small and fewer windows and is very inconvenient to shoot sitting in the aisle or middle seat.  For this either you have to make them allot seat of all your ferries in advance or you can get in touch a with local unauthorised guys who can make you get your preferred seats. Mare booking online safari does not guarantee you a good vantage point on the steamer.  2. Carry telephoto zoom lens if possible 100-400 and above as the steamer you are in will be 150-400 meter away from the banks where most of the herbivore are spotted. Birds are comparatively easier to shoot as most of them nest on dead trunks in the Periyar lake."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,nice santuary,"Though its a tiger reserve you wont find any tigers normally here.you could spot some elephants,boars,guars,spotted deer,kingfisher etc.tickets are fair priced and places are well maintained."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,We saw the elephants,"We had a trek with one of the park's rangers, it was a fantastic experience. Saw many animals, and almost no other people. Magical."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Boat Ride,"It was very boring and didn’t see any animals as such.. we got tickets at 9.30am, May be that could be the reason.. suggest choose 7.30 am one if you are planning"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,NOT TOO OVER MAN MANAGED - STILL VERY NATURAL,"Fortunately our driver had us up very early in the morning so we avoided queues for tickets bus and then avoided queue at the lake when purchasing ticket for cruise including a camera/photography ticket - with all the form filling this was just as well. Soon comfortably seated in the waiting area until disturbed by loud ""thumb"" and then shrieks and laughter. Cheeky monkeys began to come down through trees onto the roof to try to snatch food and bags. Before long we were boarded having to put life jackets on. Strict rules apply: no standing, no moving about, wear life jacket at all times. Our seats [no choice given] were 23 & 24 on the upper deck. Perfect. Such stillness, peace and calm - surely tigers would be about. No such luck however we did see wild dogs, boar [warthog?], buffalo, deer, elephants and kingfishers. Our fellow Indian travellers [school holiday time so mostly honeymoon couples and Northern Indians] wanted to take photos/selfies with us which was great fun too - gave us opportunities to speak to people and exchange information. Would do this all again. [Not sure if audio tickets available. Definitely camera/photography tickets.]"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Boating tickets gets sold out online. Weather check must,Boating tickets gets sold out online. We were not aware of online tickets in first place. We stayed in the queue till the boating and were told no tickets available. Next day we went in the morning very early and was able to grab the last ticket to boat. Getting tickets booked online before travel is highly recommended. There were lot of monkeys and it grands soft drinks and plastic covers. Don’t open any snacks in open area. The numbers were huge and it can’t be controlled.  Animals comes to water only when it is very hot days in the past weeks( it means no water inside forest). During our visit it had rained previous two days so no major sighting. Please check the weather and book the tickets
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A very peaceful trip.,This is a pleasant place for a boat trip. Seeing otters was a bonus but nothing in the way of big Indian wildlife on show when we visited. Safety is clearly a priority judging by the hefty life jackets and it is very well organised.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful naturistic sanctuary,"The sanctuary is located at a walkable distance from the Kumily bus stand. You have to first buy tickets for the bus, boating and entry. It costs around 280 for a person. They arrange the government bus which takes you to the boating from the ticketing point. It is approximately 3-4KM from the ticket counter. You can also go by walk (Trekking) but you need to get permission from the forest department and they might accompany you on the trekking journey."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Well worth a visit,"We only had a day in the area so just visited the park for a cruise. The on-line ticket website only currently works with Indian debit / credit cards so we had to get out hotel travel desk to book, which incurred an additional charge bit only a few hundred rupees. Short walk to the gate where purchased park entry tickets and camera tickets. Then onto a bus for 15 minute ride into the park. Waited a few minutes for the 3:30 cruise (early morning or late afternoon are best apparently). The cuise itself was lovely - relaxing and stunningly beautiful. Not much wildlife to see, but worthwhile nevertheless."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Rich Flora and Fauna! Nature at its Best!!!,"Tried bamboo rafting and nature walk at the national park. If you are lucky enough you might spot Elephants, Bisons, wild boars, Sambar Deer, unique butterflies, malabar squirrel, lion tailed macaque, other varieties of monkeys etc. I have spotted all these animals with the 3 visits to the park. It's a paradise for any botanist or plant lover. With all the variety of flora available in the park it's definitely worth a visit."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good it was visiting this place,We visited this place in a group and we loved visiting this place..very well maintained place and completely green..if you are lucky then you get a chance to see wildlife..but yes spice plantation was good..
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Lucky to spot a wild Elephant,"In Periyar, we have taken a steamer ride on through the river. One has to very lucky to spot an animal. We are extremely lucky to spot an elephant and few birds. The boat capacity is about 30 person. To visit the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, 1) you have to go to the Bus terminus to get a forest department bus. Go as early as possible. The 1st bus starts around 7am and boat ride 7:30 am. As days go queue in bus stand and boat jetty goes 2) then go boating reservation counter and buy a boat ticket by showing the bus ticket and filling up a form. 3) Then wait at the jetty the gate when the next boat starts. 4) Please try to take an upper deck seat. Tell that in the booking counter. 5) Don't throw away the ticket, it will be need to get to the return bus  Last beware of monkeys in the waiting area."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,One needs to be lucky to spot the animals,May be if you venture deep in to the forest you may find some wildlife but the beaten path never gets ant sight of animals. When you take a boat ride in the lake you may spot some animals ashore.......
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Just a Boatride in Lake,"It is just a simple boatride in the lake. DOn't expect anything exciting or any specific animal to be seen.If you are lucky, then you would see few deers,sometime elephants."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Trekking and Rafting,"We went on a full days trekking and rafting tour, whilst it was challenging and rewarding, I felt that it went on a bit too long, and the route taken was to a halfway point and back again.  I also felt that some parts were contrived (the skulls, the porcupine quills, the tiger 'scratch marks and footprint' the 'elephant beds'...)  We got to see wild elephants, wild boar and number of plants and birds, there was no need for the added drama!"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Could have been better.....,"Visited as part of a tour group. Your experience may well depend on who your guide is and which hike route you are taken on. We saw wild boar , birds and monkeys , this was without crossing the river !!. The guide had my husband make a very fast retreat from elephants......but he didn't see any. The raft crossing was not the best idea.....in fact I stayed behind........ Most of the tour group enjoyed it though."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Periyar Lake, Wildlife Boat Safari","I have done wildlife safari's by jeep this was the first time I was doing safari by boat. I was excited but also knew chances of sighting a wildlife during safari are very rare. as i expected we only could spot wild boar, Gaur and some birds. overall experience was strictly OKAY. only recommend for those who love peace & some quite time. its only a boat ride"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Amazing trekking,"It was an amazing 3-hour trek. We were lucky enough to see elephants, bison samba deer, and giant squirrel and some rare kind of birds.It is good if you take water with you."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Bamboo rafting was nice but the 10 km hike was terrible.,"A 5 km walk with no wildlife takes you to the bamboo rafting site. The guides were friendly and we saw one giant squirrel asleep in a tree. The bamboo rafting is relaxing, several good bird sightings and a group of 4 elephants at the far end of the lake. We got off the raft and walked along the shore to get closer but still quite a safe distance away. The hike back was exhausting, boring, hot and devoid of any wildlife at all. It negated overall experience."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Boat Ride on the Periyar lake,"I was very excited about going to the periyar wildlife sanctuary as I had fond childhood memories of it. Unfortunately the real experience was much more uncomfortable than I would like.  We had been told we could get the boat tickets online but none of the websites were working. We tried to book it through the agent but you have to go in person unless you are part of a large conducted tour. For a boat ride at 2.30 pm (which is the last ride) you need to get on a bus at the thekkady pick up point by 12.45 pm is what we were told. When we reached the lakeside boat pier there was no place to sit and wait. A semi sheltered area with few benches was all they had, and a ever growing crowd of tourists who kept coming in till 2.15pm! It was even worse that there were monkeys all over the place snatching food and bottles from people. It would be a small matter of announcing to the visitors not to keep food and drinks outside to prevent the panic. The signs were placed where no one could see them. The whole boarding process was chaos personified. Sadly in every boat the upper deck was with only foreigners and we were not given any options of choosing seats on upper decks. In the ride there were 3 announcements. We saw 3 elephants and 5 buffalows and 1 barasingha - which was honestly so far that i didn't ""see"" it. The return journey was even more harrowing as they didn't have enough buses to take people back and we got back to our hotel at 7.00 pm. They don't even have options of private boats for hire. All in all, extremely tiring and disappointing."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,tranquil afternoon,"a meander along the Periyar river in late afternoon is a great way to see this beautiful location. Despite a crowded boat the views are fantastic, with wildlife including elephant and bison adding to the experience. Beware of the monkeys whilst waiting for boarding and/or tickets. Park rangers on the boat were great."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Well worth the trip,The local government bus que is Always Long to get to the sanctuary but buses come regularly and it doesn’t take long to get to the reserve about ten mins. Then off the bus and more queuing to get tickets for boat trip. Best get in this que as soon as possible because tickets are linked to seat numbers and position on boat. Lots of people queuing but lots of boats so although doesn’t seem enough boats the government officials soon get everyone on board a boat. Beware of monkeys whilst waiting to board boat as although they looked small and cute they were prone to biting. We took the 3.30pm boat and was lucky and saw a herd of 7 elephants numerous bison in herds and deer and lots of birds. Off the boat you have to que again for bus back to town.
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,For bird watchers,"If you really want to watch birds and not have a lot of crowd, you should visit Elephant junction. I saw Rufus treepie, greater black tailed drongo, barbet, Malabar parakeet and so many more birds there. Jiju helps in spotting the birds and speaks English and Hindi well. He also had knowledge of spices and trees.  Elephant junction is a paradise for bird watchers if you go early in the morning.  Jiju-9497503177"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar reserve,One of the worst jungle safaris. No tigers in there. You cannot even see other animals and no proper guides are available
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,3 hour trek,"I went on a three hour trek. It was 1:1 for me, but you can double up with other travellers and split the cost. It was probably my highlight in India. The guide was a really lovely person who explained a lot about local life and really knew a lot about the wildlife. But the best was that we saw a family of 8 elephants (including a new baby) - apparently very unusual. Even the guide seemed very excited. We must have spent almost an hour watching them. A very special experience - but would have been a lovely walk even without the elephants."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Walking tour,"Amazing 3 hour walk. Saw elephants, bison samba deer, giant squirrel and all sorts of birds. Good walking shoes needed. Take water too"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Fantastic scenery bigger animals a little scarce but plenty of birdlife,"Visited by jeep safari and the main focus was a visit to Gavi dam and centre. We had a walking safari with an excellent guide who also gave us a boat trip across the dam to the waterfall at the far side, and this included getting our feet nibbled by the same fish in a rock pool. We also had lunch provided which was very good."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Lovely, but probably best if trekking","Options are: boat ride, busride or trekking. The bus and boat are with 80/120 of your closest friends, which is not quite what we imagined, however we went for the boat ride which was very well organized. The seats are numbered, so it's important to get the right seats (upper deck, by the railing, near or at the front). If you're in a good seat, the other 119 people don't actually mean that much. We saw black monkeys, elefant +baby, sambar dear and gaur (ox/bison). Trekking is probably the best way to go, but not with a two-year old."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Trekking,"Impossible to get treks when arrive in thekkady and tour agent spice holidays does not even assist to book it especially when I came all the way from Singapore. not a single trek available in the wildlife sanctuary or national park HUGE disappointment. Other than boating the sanctuary is not accessible to the public except a very small area for restaurant, toilets and monkeys intent on stealing stuff"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Avoid this place,One of the worst managed places. I would never recommend this place to anybody. It's better to be avoided. The management is poor and there's no fun standing for hours to just board a bus.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worthwhile visit - just don't expect too much,"You would be very lucky to see tigers or elephants on the boat ride given the large area of the sanctuary. However, the boat ride itself is enjoyable and we did see birds and wildlife. The most extraordinary animal for us was the red panda which looked somewhat akin to a racoon. It was a joy to see them frolicking in a field by the water. It was so disappointing though to witness one of the other boat passengers through rubbish into the water. Do hope the environmental efforts in Kerala will make this a thing of the past eventually."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice and calm place to visit,We took the early morning boat ride to the national park but did not spot any wildlife except a group of elephants on the lake shore.the boat ride was average and not worth the wait for the tickets.
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Roller coaster ride,"Periyar tiger reserve won’t show you even a single dog. We were very excited to take this tour as we thought some animals will be there to welcome us but unfortunately this off road experience is just looting the money and showing you the sunset points leave alone the terrible experience of off road, roads are so horrible that one can literally feel sick post the tour so be aware and there is nothing to see exacept one point where there is some lake and few lotus, won’t advice to go for this one"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Green walk: A walk to remember,"We went there on the eve of a 3 day weekend as a gang of 4 friends. Still we didn't got tickets for any of the activities arranged on that day. So we decided to take a free walk around the park, called pugmark trail in the tiger reserve. While we went to collect the tickets, we luckily got 4 tickets from the foreigners who were looking for extra persons in their walk. So it is better to plan the trip and reserve the tickets. The ticket cost is 350 per head and entry ticket to park is 33 per head. About the green walk, it is a great experience and we happen to see elephants, gaur, wild deer, gaint squirrel etc. It was so exciting to see wild elephants taking down the trees at a distance of 30 feet. The walk lasted for around 8 kms, so it is better to take water bottle with you. There will be steeps and slopes, so it is not recommended for elderly people."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great visit,"We visited this as part of a three week trip to southern India and Kerala. We were taken to the lake by coach and once on the boat we saw two dholes (rare hunting dogs) which we hadn't seen whilst staying at Dholes Den in Bandipur. We spotted gaur (a type of bison), elephants and many birds. It was well worth a visit. The toilets at the top were clean, always a plus point on any trip !"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,We enjoyed our afternoon boat trip,Doing this 1 hours boat trip is a great experience watching out for wildlife or simply enjoying the quiet and green environment. A great place to make photographs of sunken tree trunks. Great light at the afternoon.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good sighting but less animals,You will not find many animals here except deer and wild buffaloes. You can avoid if you are not in love with wildlife.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"dense forest, difficult sightings","it was a very clean natural reserve. boating was at fixed times. its a good idea to go in advance and get seats, as its on first come first serve basis. one can take day walks and nature walks. sightings though would be rare"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,See periyar tiger reserve,See periyar tiger reserve If you really want to see animals you have to stay in park Archaic system of staying in line paying for bus fare (Rs 20 for Indians) then another line and pay for boat and entry to park (Rs 33 and 225). Though there are many boats sometimes they get full so get in lines early or book on line which may be slightly more expensive
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,A place to avoid,This place is not worth the effort. There is nothing much in this place than the so called boating on the lake were you find some wild boars and deers. It was a total waste of time and effort as you more beautiful places in Kerala
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Please avoid as hardly SBI animals,Hardly any animals to see when u go into the sanctuary.. saw elephants which were way too far.. so U can easily skip this place..
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Lots of options,"This is called a tiger reserve but there is 990sq kms & only 33 tigers so little chance to see one. There are various walks from 2 hours- full day undertaken by the Periyar foundation and also boat trips There are elephant, wild boar, various deer, gaur(bison) which we saw from the boat and there are lots of both water & forest birds, interesting plants & trees and plenty of bonnet macaques. An interesting & relaxed place to visit but don't have high hopes for tigers & elephants"
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Highly overrated,This place is terribly overrated. We visited in the last week December of (2017) which happened to be the peak season. We were made to stand in long queues for over 2 hours (we visited the ticket counter at 6.15am in the morning - we could manage to get only 9.30am boating tickets) just to enjoy boating for 1.5 hours - where they claim you could possibly spot animals. There was absolutely no animals there when we took the boat ride.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Early Start with Little to Show,We made a very early start to experience this park and hopefully see a tiger or other wildlife. Not successful this time....maybe on another venture.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Painful system for getting them in and underwhelming experience,"We had to get up at 5am to be in the queue for tickets when the office opened at 5:45 for the 7:30 am boat. Once we got the tickets, we had to get on a bus and the queue again inside the sanctuary for boat tickets. From the viewing platform, we saw bison and small monkeys came down to steal food from tourists. There were idiots feeding them.  The boat itself was well organised with seat numbers and life jackets following a terrible accident in 2009. Best thing we saw was a family of otters playing in the water. Also a big lizard. We hadn’t expected tigers but an elephant would have been nice. The boats are so noisy so it’s not really surprising. But quite a pleasant boat ride if you set your expectations low."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Take binoculars,"Our boat ride was in the early morning. It seemed at bit frenetic and disorganized, but once we all got boarded (and wore the mandatory life jackets) we were out on the lake.  Binoculars will help you see the birds and animals. The guides do a good job of seeing things the rest of could never find.  One guide took my camera and got some wonderful pictures of the birds for me!  If you're doing a tour of South India, see if you can't spend two nights in Periyar."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,90 Mins Worth It,"Periyar wildlife sanctuary is only a boat ride on the Periyar Lake for 90 mins. There are trips scheduled across the day. Morning or late evening trips maximize chance of seeing wild animals. In our trip we saw quite a few elephants, monkeys, a few gaurs (keeping see up mountains-they come down only to drink water and not too easy to spot), birds, monitor lizards, wild boars. That said, it is a matter of luck to spot wild animals. Disappointment may be a possibility.  The tickets cost about 250 and can be purchased only. You will have validate line ticket at the counter. Also, if you are driving down, please note that the parking is 1km before the reserve entrance and a PTR bus takes you inside. There is no other option. Unless, you have a booked accommodation inside the reserve."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice Sanctuary,You can visit this place by two ways. Trakkeing and boating. I prefere boating. beacuse it is easy. If you want to see wild animals then go early in the morning.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Nice as a sanctuary, disappointing wrt spotting wildlife",It is a beautiful national park no doubt. But if you are visiting during winter then chances of spotting wildlife during the boat cruise are very very thin. It's only the monkeys and the lemurs which revealed themselves and could be counted as wildlife. One can spot beautiful birds though :) We were told that in order to increase our chances of spotting wildlife one should visit during the warmer seasons and take the 1st boat cruise of the day.
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not a visit worth its name for,"Noneth the Wildlife , Noneth the sanctuary to spot any wild amidst dense fauna.  Its worth a splendid time to experience bio diverse green foliage of vast expanse and a 1 hour or more to destress oneself instead of aspiring one to spot a wild name it a kind or a wild animal.  The place may be advisable for an early morning visit for aspiring to brighten one with widlife existnce. by early afternoon to evening sunset, one may be surely feel deprived of the significance of this place for which one has took out time and paid money to the tour operators.  Kindly donot waste money ones if you may have same sanctuary in every cities one may come from."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,A Lovely experience and some wildlife to see,"We did the 7:30 am walking safari, the guide was great and we saw deer and bison, but as this is dense jungle, sighting wildlife is difficult, but its worth the effort,"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good nature view,We had a boat ride through the periyar river which runs through the wildlife sanctuary. We got a distant view of the elephants and bison from the boat. All in all it was a good experience.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good for nature lovers..,"Its a great place for those who are nature lovers and who are in wildlife photography. We actually sight some beautiful animals on our visit. You can opt for trekking, bamboo rafting, boating etc."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Excellent, as long as you don't expect it to be like a zoo!","We visited the reserve just for one day, we did the boat trip in the morning and a 'nature walk' in the afternoon. Apparently the best time to go out on the boat is first thing in the morning which is what we did, and did see a lot of wildlife. Pro's: the lake is beautiful, and we were lucky enough to see a lot of wildlife including elephants. Con's: the organisation is chaotic at best, we asked lots of advice before going and it was still manic. You need to buy park entry and then queue for the bus into the park at least 90min before the boat trip starts to have any hope of getting on. Tickets are allocated first come first served, and seats are allocated, we were lucky again and got allocated seats at the front on the top deck. Another Con however, is that most people are incredibly noisy, and as much as the guide on the boats asks people to keep quiet, some people just won't be, so if you are a real wildlife enthusiast you will find it frustrating.  A better way to enjoy the reserve in a more peaceful way is by a three hour nature walk. Our guide was fantastic, and we saw lots of wildlife.  If you go here expecting to see tigers you will be disappointed! That's not what this place is about, it's a reserve intended to provide a safe habitat for the wildlife here, it is not a safari park. It is a successful reserve because tourists and visitors are kept contained within a small area and are not permitted to get too close to the animals."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Awesome Jungle Walk,"Jungle walk is great fun and learning Can spot wild animals and birds easily Very Good Guides with local knowledge Must place for Visit at Thekkady Vast Natural Beauty to experience Must wear Shoes, Cap, and Carry small meal and drinking water It can be a Half day event to enjoy"
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Total waste of time and money,Visited this place but its total waste of time and money! Everything from vechicle parking fees to entry fees to boat ride fees is total waste. There is nothing to see and the authorities are only looting the tourists with exorbitant fees.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,must do activity,amazing boatride for approximately 90minutes. it was worth the experience once we there around 2-30pm for boatride which was going to start at 3-30pm. while returning back we need to wait for the bus pickup as it there was long queue of travellers to reach city. overall boatride with sightseeing makes it a perfect visit in thekkady for this activity.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Calm and serene,"We visited this place with a prior online booking which needs to be done 48 hours before on periyarlakefoundation.org. The online payment did not work but the prior online attempt ensured that we got a place on the boat as all we need to do is go to the office and show them the online receipt and the officer provides you a confirmation of the seat, if available. We booked the 3.30 pm slot which was perfect. The boat staff was very helpful and pointed out the animals from a distance. We were lucky enough to catch a glimpse of deers, bisons and a few exotic birds. The experience is amazing as the boat ride lasts for 1.30 hours and the lake is beautiful."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Must Do - Gavi Safari for Bird watch lovers and some wild life.,"We did the Gavi safari and ended up with one of the best safari. As a Bird watch lover was amazed to see so many spices of bird's. We sighted Malabar squirrel's, Monkey's, a group of Elephants, group of Bisons, Sambar, Deer etc. I do recommend this tour for everyone and don't forget the camera."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Natural reserve in India - between chaotic organisation and beautiful jungle,"To get in you have to get 2 different tickets from two different places, 500 m from each other: - one for the parc entrance - one for the tour (you cannot go in without a tour). Take a walking tour. You may be Lucky and. See a lot of animals (we actually saw the free, beautiful elephants, even a mother and her baby) but it s not a guarantee. This is not a zoo but a reserve. In any case, it will be a very nice walk with a lot of information on Indian nature and animals and plants. Prepare for leeches. They give you protective socks, but you should also wear. Trousers, Lang shirt, closed shoes. For us: the absolutely dream - but as I said, we were very lucky. Should habe played loto."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice place for animal lovers,"It is nice place or main tourist spot in thekkedy,you can visit this sanctuary by hiring a jeep by govt agencies or you can cruise in periyar lake which is in center of this tiger reserve,you can always spot bison,deers and wild boars on shores of lake if you are lucky you can see elephants and tigers.ticket booking stops by 3'o clock in rainy seasons.it is awesome place to visit"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Never do it. It's a total scam!,"Unless you are waiting for a picknick on a garbagebelt this is 1 of the most awful experiences of India. If you want to see wildlife I can suggest to open you internetbrowser and look on google images. Driving in collones of 60 vehicles to 2 or 3 gatheringpoints where everyone is shooting, eating and litterly throwing there litter and plastic off the hills in the wildlife forests. The government should do something about it instead of promoting this. It's a total corrupt scam!"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary,"Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary is a beautiful place of tigers,sambar deers etc.Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the best sanctuaries in the world."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,A cruise to periyar..a memory of lifetime,"The cruise at Periyar lake is just awesome experience for us.As we have chosen the cruise for 2 times, one at evening and one at early morning. We find plenty of wild animal at evening[like sambar and barking deer, Bison,many species of Birds], and the freshness of lake making us overwhelmed at morning. As there is very high demand of ticket, so i like to advice to avoid long queue, do book online your confirm spot. We booked it one month prior our visit and get hassle free ticket at online counter on Boat starting point and get upper deck seat without any queue. The total procedure here is very systematic. The one and a half hour cruise in the tranquil lake will make you feel out of the world."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature Lovers in depth of forest of western guards,"The forest ride is 120 km which covers entire western guards. Its awesomely treat for nature loves, the Best place for birdwatchers its 500 species of birds resist in this long going forest. And can find inner tribal community staying inside."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beutiful and calm place,"We took the nature walk with a guide and it eas fantastic. Then we took the boat with all the touristsand insist on sesting in the first raw wich was a good decision. Both the little trek and the boat were so nice, so calm and so beutiful. Dont expect to see animals so you will not be dissapointing. Just the nature ...s"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Green walk in the forest,"This was a walk into the forest. The price was 200-300 per adult and had a minimum ticket of 1200 . The guide Satheesh was excellent , with good experiences in the forest. A leech protection sock is given to be worn under the shoes to be safe from leeches of the forest . A 3 and half hour walk in the forest is all you can ask for. Visibility of animals may depend on the time of visit but the walk is worthy of the amount paid. Carry a mosquito repellent, wear thick shoes and carry water in the bag."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Fairly OK place,Not such a great place. Very crowded. Boat ride is Ok. The scenery is good. Long queues to get inside and at the boat ride.
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Too touristy and noisy to see any wildlife,We wanted to trek in the forest. What a waste of time. So many people no chance of seeing any wild life other than few monkeys waiting for tourists to feed them. Can only walk in road bus takes. Complete waste of time. If you want to see wild life go to Nager Hole on Kabini River near Wayanard. Safaris there on smaller vehicles and great sitings. Locals told us in Periyer that they had lived there for 10 years and never seen a tiger.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,A ride in the woods,"Must go activity if you are in Thekkady.We booked the ticket online. Got front seat at the upper deck in the boat. We visited the sanctuary during raining season. Though seeing wildlife is not guaranteed the boat trip is worth the effort just sit and relax and enjoy the scenic beauty. We took some photos as well. Take a zoom lens for better picture. You will be lucky if you sight some animals. Beware of monkeys at the waiting area , they may snatch your bag/food and run away."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Don't miss the chance to see wild life.,We enjoyed a day visiting the wild life sanctuary when we stayed at the Spice Village in Thekkady. It is worth the visit even though getting there is a slow and long journey. Don't miss it!
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Its a nice experience but not that great,"If you are with kids then they will surely love the ride, else avoidable. There are other things to do while in Thekkady like you can visit the Gavi Forest."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wilderness At Its Best,Must go activity if you are in Thekakdy. Boating inside sanctury is worth to go and try to take early morning or last boating as more chances to spot animals  we had a good time.. definitely recommend
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not exciting...we got bored,Been there with friends.nit very good.boat goes too slow and very little animals or birds to see. Maybe you can see some rare birds but overall for me totally waste of time
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Gotta be Lucky to see animals,"It's big. We took the long day trip riding in a jeep for 12+ hours. Saw a few monkeys, a dead snake. That's it. No surprise when you're rumbling around in a loud jeep on a fixed path. Guide said he'd seen a tiger only three times in 30 years, and occasionally but less rarely an elephant. If you want to do this reserve, canoe along the river. You probably have a better chance seeing more wildlife. Also save yourself the pain from riding in an automobile for a whole day. A jeep is just like riding in a car, only worse and long and little to see but nature, which is fine for a few hours, but unexceptional for much longer"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,beautiful scenery,"Though seeing wildlife is not guaranteed the boat trip is worth the effort just sit and relax as the boat winds it`s way through submergeged trees, cormorants and kingfisher, wild deer and yes a glimse of wild elephant, though I think that an opportunity is missed to inform and educate visitors about the park and wildlife."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice Sanctuary,"One of the excellent experience to spent the time here during your holidays, we have spent excellent time with our group here."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Its an awesome place,"We loved our experience of living in a forest with huge trees older than 100 years old. We walked, cycled and even trekked at night with the forest rangers. A must do for all nature lovers. TIP: Try to live at a hotel inside the forest."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Pleasant getaway,"We went for the boat ride inside the sanctuary. It was early in the morning. There was mile long queue, the likes of the demonetization variety, at 5.45 am itself for the 6:30 opening counter. We would have expected there to be token systems issued online to prevent the long queue waits and people using ingenious tricks to beat the crowd. But against all odds we reached the boats and the drive is only about 40mins although is touted for 1.5 hours. But the ride is heavenly and one can see many birds and animals.the otters, water buffaloes, deers boars etc. Don't expect elephants and Tigers though, realistically. We took some neat fotos. Take a zoom lens for sure."
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Sheer waste if time and money!,"Heavily priced and overrated place. We went during August, were disappointed by this visit.. They had shut down online ticket reservations.. We had to stand in the queue since 5 am for getting 2 tickets for a 9:30 am slot.. The boat ride was boring, some people slept for the entire ride.. There were no animals visible till horizon.. Pls dont waste your money in visiting Thekkady.."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Picturesque,"This is a heart-warming place, very well-maintained and peaceful. The boating experience was breathtaking and we were lucky to spot wild dogs during their feast on a deer! Mother Nature!"
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Costly,Every one need to pay for entrance to do noting there and pay again for boating . It is costly to go there for one hour and half
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wildlife paradise,"It's a hidden gem in kerala. Big, vast and wild. The best part is lake in the middle and you can enjoy wildlife while boating. This is one of the biggest in india and lush green. Must visit place during your Kerala visit."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Average and satisfactory,The travel experience through this was not at all good for us. We were standing on the bus for all time and the disturbance of monkeys were also there. Over all it is an average package for tourists.... dont want to go again and again...
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Interesting day,"We booked this tour on our arrival in Thekkady but could have pre booked online which might be sensible. We chose the half day trek with bamboo rafting which set off at 0730. They provide a backpack with water, fruit & 'breakfast' of a very stodgy Dosa & thin soup. I'd recommend eating something beforehand as you don't stop for breakfast for a couple of hours.  You must wear long trousers & will be provided with over socks to wear over your socks which tie under the knee, over the end of trousers to ward against leeches. This can make shoes a little tight & uncomfortable as it's a long & tiring trek. I'd only recommend this if you are happy to walk at least 5 miles.  Guides were very good & very informative - eager to point out plants, animals & birds. We did see some lovely birds including bright blue kingfishers & eagles. We also saw water buffalo & a scorpion but most other animals were absent. Just as we came back into town we saw some monkeys & a giant squirrel in the distance but nothing else.  The lack of animals to see was disappointing & whilst we had been pre warned that sightings couldn't be guaranteed we had hoped to see more than we did. Don't go expecting to see a huge amount of wildlife as you will be disappointed."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not good one!,"ok ok place..just walk thro' ,spend some time, take a snap and come back ..nothing much to do.. you can skip it"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Best to visit early hours,"If you wish to see the wild animals, the best time to visit is early morning. The Periyar lake is a beautiful place inside the Sanctuary and worth spending some time watching the greenery and wildlife."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Simply incredible,"Periyar wildlife sanctuary is simply magnificent. For a tourist from the UK, I thoroughly enjoyed my day trip here which was made special by the sighting of a small family of wild elephants. I'll never forget my visit here!  You can only enter via a government guided tour. As per most places in India, foreigners are charged considerably more than locals. However the beauty of this place is more valuable than money"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Thekkady Jeep Safari,"All I can say about the trip is ""Over charged, over crowded and badly littered point to point 4X4 track. Was charged 3300 + 50 for debit card payment (so much for Modi's go cashless) for family jeep ride. All we did was went hill to hill looking at same mountain range and no animal. Though saw couple of dogs on trail ;) Not recommended to spend lots of money on average ride..."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good place to visit specially for kids,"Book your tickets online, this is an amazing place. Long lenses are must have here, worth every money you spend here."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Stay inside the ktdc lodging in Gavi,It's ethereal to write about this place. Some tips -  Stay at ktdc lodging in gavi Stay at least for three days if you really want to see tigers and elephants. Start your journey early if you wanna get glimpse of wild animals There is no cell phone tower inside. You ll be lost in wilderness for a while and it's good for you. The guides are excellent. Listen to them Don't litter. It's your country.
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Jungle Safari,Actually forest department is not managing this activity and local peoples are making fools of tourists by name of jungle safari. They will take you 35 kilometres from thekkady on some rough terrain. that's all and no animals are available
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar Tiger reserve Jungle camp,"Jungle camp near Vallakadavu Forest checkpost is a wonderful experience of stay in a forest. Staff are very hospitable and the camp feels quite secure even though it is in tiger country, Food is not at all a problem and infact it is better than the food served at many of the resorts in Thekkady.Enjoyed a typical Kerala cuisine. Package includes a 2 hr trek in the forest and a good climb uphill for a very scenic view of the forest. Good chances of viewing elephants/ Gaur / deers Nature walk for birdwatching and a drive through the forest upto the Gavi eco tourism location is also included. Boating on periyar is also available as part of this package. We were lucky to see Nilgiri Marten at very close range and for a good period of time to take some pics .. This is a very rare species i understand and can be seen only in the Western ghats. Do not miss to include this in your itinerary."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Real Touch Of Nature,"Periyar Wild Life Sanctuary is must do tour who love the nature. We started our tour in morning by first boat which start @ 07:30. There are some important things to note like if you want to take early morning tour than must get your tickets before 05:50 am. Try to stay near by hotels of this area. We enjoyed our boat tour very much. It was silent peaceful and Wow....first u need to by the bus ticket from their first couonter than the bus 'll drop at wildlife sanctuary where again you need to buy the ticket for boat. bus ticket was 53 rs and boat ticket price:225 per adult. They have limited quota for every tor like they operate the tour full day first tour on 07:30 than 09:00 than 11:00 like this but morning time is best to enjoy as this time we can see animals like forest dog, deer elephant and all... If someone likes natural photography than this is must do tour."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature Life.,"The sanctuary is also known as Thekkady. If you visit there book boat tickets in advance otherwise ticket is not get. A nice place for trekking, there is lot of trekking packages are available. Enjoy the flora and fauna of the nature."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Eco Tourism,"A nice place for trekking, boating , elephant ride and many more nature discovering. Loved so much. Never can this place be missed."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Extraordinary variety of flora and fauna - Nature at its best,"South India is home to an extraordinary variety of flor and fauna, with many of its most exotic species native to the region. We learned a lot about the area's rich biodiversity while on a jungle walk in the national park. It is set high in the Cardamom Hills. This park includes 62 animal special including: elephants, wild boar, leopards, will dogs, and monkeys. During the 2 hour walk we saw no animals but many birds, and the walk was lovely."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,A unique Wildlife Safari .....,"Also known as Periyar Tiger Reserve, is Near Theekady.  But watching Tiger is difficult, however one see Sambar deer, Indian Bison, Elephants.  Lake is famous for Boat Ride, which covers the wild life sanctuary.  Very well Managed by KTDC."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Awesome!!!,The trip is a must visit in Thekady. The nature at its best can only be felt not said. The wildlife is not not much to be seen though.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,its rare to see some wild animals ...,we have visted this in the month of june ... its nohing to see here asyuare o able to see any wild animals ... or some rare animals ...
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,A dull boat safari.,"We took the 1.5hour boat safari through the lake that winds through the reserve. Its a bird watchers paradise however animal sightings were a nought. A deer and wild bison is what we got to see in the entire ride.  The boat safari costs about INR 400/Head even for children ( 5 and above. lesser go free). The good part is all chairs have good views and the seats are numbered. The staff seems to be more attentive towards ""foreigners"" - a sad truth ! A resident guide delivers un-interested explanations.  The silence and peace is enjoyable as you chug along the reserve lake, but after 30-45 minutes kinds of gets boring. Jeep safaris and elephant safari s are also an option offered however i did not try them.  The boat safari takes off at 2 times, one i believe is at 6 am, but i took the 9.30 am one. it is said that the early morning safari has more chances of spotting animals who come to drink water from the lake. Try your luck,."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wonderland hike,We had two guides who took us off the well worn path and we were able to see animals grazing naturally Beautiful and varied ecosystems Guides were knowledgable and spoke very good english
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature at its best,"If you are in love with nature, you will not be disappointed to visit this place. You can either take a boat ride through the lake or can trek through the jungle or can take a jeep safari. The only caution is, tiger is hardly ever seen."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Elephants and Monkeys seen. Well worth a visit.,"Visited on foot with local guide, Raju. Within 15 minutes we found the remains of a Goar bull that had been killed by a tiger the previous night. Luckily, he was not in the area when we were! A further 15 minutes and we saw 11 elephants in the distance, who were aware that we were there. Others of our group had spotted Porcupines, so a place well worth visiting. Guides are from the Hill tribes so they know the area intimately and are very knowledgeable. In the rainy season this park is turned into a vast lake, it was dry when we were there."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,One of the must places to visit,ood experience and away from city. Try to use Bicycles at entrance gate than bus. You really love cycling in a fresh open air :).  Beware of Monkeys around at boating point. Govt Restaurant was really good and upscale one.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,No animals spotted although a picturesque scene,"KTDC has a facility of many different types of options available to tour Periyar , out of which boat safari is the best. it is a 2 hour safari in a lake which devides periyar jungle into 2 halves.The sanctuary looks beautiful, however didn't spot any animals except some sambhars , wild dogs and some birds. Getting the ticket for the safari was a very difficult task and the sanctuary was not worth the effort. All the tickets were sold out on day 1. We woke up at 5 am to get tickets early morning next day. we chose to pay middlemen some amount for quick work. It turned out to be wise decision since many people who turned up at the same time didnt get the tickets due to queuues and processing haggle.  Tip - Carry Govt. Id to get tickets Book the tickets online to avoid the haggle. Online booking gets sold out soon. Do it atleast 1 week prior to the visit."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Don't expect tigers & elephants,"This is a the most popular wildlife sanctuary in South India. But unless you go very early in the morning or at dusk there is little chance of seeing elephants or the elusive tigers. But we did see a variety of birds, monkeys, & sambar."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Lovely but get there on time!,"Unfortunately we missed out on half of our 2.5 hour green walk due to confusion around where to collect our tickets, filling out paperwork etc. We saw deer, many birds, monkeys and wild cows. The guides took a short cut back along a road instead of through the national park, which was disappointing."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar wildlife sanctuary,A days trip in jeep is very interesting during our stay. Highly recommended for youngsters as they can survive the jerks. Views on the way are very beautiful and trip is memorable. You will be lucky if you sight some animals. But forget tiger sighting
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice - Must Visit Place,"beware of monkeys , they may snatch your bad and run away , No Tiger here , carry ur high end camera"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,nice place to visit with family,i had visited this place twice and i feel relex here as this place provide peace and you can have fun with family here . there is boat ride too at very nominal cost for tourist . i will visit here again
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good place to see wild life by boating,Better to visit this place in early morning or evening. Boating in periyar lake is best activity to do in this place. In pick season better to book your ticket for boating early by online reservation. Best slot is in morning 7:30 am.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,A Walk in the Woods,"Unfortunately, we didn't see much wildlife. We did see, however, two different groups of Indian Bison grazing in the woods. We also saw several varieties of plants during our guided walk."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,nice experience,nice experience. Enjoyed every thing specially the monkeys & other birds which otherwise we miss while in the City.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar Lake,"The most popular activity in Periyar is the Periyar lake boat safari. They have 4 boat safari time slots in a day (7:30, 9:30, 11:30, and 15:30). Each slot has usually 2/3 boats taking in 30 tourists each. We got a chance to see Wild Boars, Indian Bisons, Elephants, and hundreds of thousands of water-birds. Make sure to book your boat ride online in advance to avoid long queues and disappointment at the last moment. Try for one of the two morning safaris (7:30 or 9:30) when the chances of spotting wild animals are usually higher than the other times of day."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not spotted many animals,"It's a good sanctuary,but we expected elephants walking periyar riverside,but we didn't.That may be luck.bisons pigs,monkeys ,birds ,deers we can spot.know about boating timings correctly."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good walk,"Our walk was for 2 hrs, did not see that much wildlife as was in middle of day, but did come across elephants on the track out."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature walk and boat ride,"Visited in Jan'17. Overall it was quite average and a letdown. First booked for the 3 hour nature walk, which was actually only 2 hours as the guide took his own time getting ready and then we got back early as well. The walk was allright, we started from the bota landing, over fairly flat ground and some swampy areas and then ventured into the forest periphery. We saw lots of fresh elephant dung, evidence of a herd having passed quite recently but unfortunately didnt see the actual elephants. We did see quite a lot of exotic birds including some that the guide said were quite rare, 4-5 bisons from a distance and giant squirrels.There was also a bison carcass from what the guide said was a recent tiger kill. Overall it was a decent walk, but the guide could have been better and they should stick to the time advertised. Be sure to pick up a walking stick, there are generally many available at the starting point, this does make walking much easier. The following day we went for the Periyar lake boat ride. As it was a nice cool day, it was enjoyable, but except for some black monkeys and wild pigs we didnt see any other wildlife. I understand the early morning 7.30 am and the late evening 3.30 pm rides have a better chance of spotting wildlife however as we booked at the last minute the previous day tickets for these were not available. For both of these be sure to bring a good long distance camera or binoculars if you want to view the wildlife as the view is generally from quite far away. For the boat ride be sure to book only online as its complete chaos at the booking counter as demand seems to be far higher than supply so its first come first served and if you are at the back of the queue you may not get a slot for the days boating if all seats get sold out. Currently the lake water level is way down due to insufficient rains so they have cut back on the number of daily boats and rides. Booking can be done on the periyar foundation online site for all activities. tFor the boat ride, get to the boat landing half an hour before and there is a separate counter where you submit your confirmed booking and they will assign you the boat and the seat numbers."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,A cool boat ride,This is the only place in Thekkady to visit i.e. Periyar wild life sanctuary. We were taken by a big boat which had a complete round of sanctuary in one & half hours. But no animals were seen on the whole way except some bison and seal.
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed with this place. This was part of an organised tour for me, so I didn't know what to expect. Firstly you buy a ticket in the city centre, which doesn't not guarantee a boat ride. Then you go inside and wait in another line (about 1.5 hours) just to get a boat ticket. As there are limited seats everyone is really anxious and not letting anyone pass them. After all you don't want to lose you seat after all that waiting. Then you wait another hour (you can walk around, but there is nothing to see) for the boat departure time. Then you get crammed into a boat with others, and if your lucky you may see an animal or two, 200m away.  Really disappointed with this place, and how poorly organised it is. All I really remember is all the lines I had to wait in, and everyone anxious about loosing their place. Tip for organisers of this disaster: Allow people to buy boat tickets when they buy entry tickets.  If I knew better I would have done the trek."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Advance planning advisable!,"Must plan a trip to the sanctuary, online bookings are best and easy. To make it memorable carry camera with telescopic lens and binoculars as well.  If you are lucky you would come across a herd of elephants, a few Wild Gaurs ( Bisons), Giant Squirrel and an occasional reptile or two. During wet weather take special care to protect yourself from Leeches.  Wonderfully well kept Sanctuary!!"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,WildLife,"Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary,you can see it from boat.Surrounded by water and trees.you can feel the spirit of adventure here."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature walk,"We had the nature walk at the sanctuary a day earlier. The nature walk was for 2.30 hours. The guide was well versed with various animals & plants. We spotted a wild bison, elephants, a snake & some exotic birds. We were in Thekkady only for a day. Wish we could have stayed a day longer & explored the forest some more"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,This is what you have to do in Thekedy!,"From the title, the only thing i want to emphasis is, dont miss visiting wildlife sanctuary while in thekkedy. There are numerous activities possible, just visit forest department to get an idea on what to do..."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Awesome wildlife,Yup we indeed got to seem some wildlife in real and not in zoos. The guides were professional and skilled to locate the wildlife from far off. Nice place
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Average - Good for a visit,"The place is a bit hyped. We couldnt see a single animal during the visit. One piece of advice - Book tickets online in advance. Else you may have to wait in queue at the site office. Also, be careful while booking online. Remember to keep the transaction numbers. Due to poor internet connectivity in the area, my transaction had failed but was still charged on my credit card . I never rece themoney back!  About the attraction - Its an average place. The boat would take you around the jungle. The lake is good and clean . Overall its a good boat ride. However, if you are going only for watching wildlife, you may end up disappointed!"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Quite well kept and neat park,"It was a great place to visit and get inspired about nature, especially if you are travelling with young kids. Be very cautious about the monkeys. If you plan a trip, please book a boat ride in advance and check if there is enough water in the reservoir to have a good experience."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Breathtaking!!,Guyz..book early tickets to sanctuary well in advance else you will miss the real beauty of this unique sanctuary...seeing tigers while you are travelling through boat is just a unique experience in itself!!! Also even if you aren't lucky to see the animals there are many other activities listed on their site..do check this well in advance
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,walk the jungle,"Probably the only national park/sanctuary which allows you to walk through it. We took the nature walk in which we walked thru the park with help of a guide.We took the nature walk which is probably the most tame of the three offered and walked through 5-6 kms of undulating terrain and while quite enjoying the terrain did not see see any animals besides a few bisons and a single wild boar, The better walsk are the green walk which is through deeper jungle and the jungle scout which is in three slots at night in which you walk through the jungle at 10,00, 11-00 and 1-00 at night accompanied by two gun men and a guide.THAT is where you see all the wild animals BUT the slots are few and bookings have to be done in advance on the ne"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature walk@Periyar reserve,"It was a memorable experience. We went with low expectations. We were not expecting to see tigers during day time ofcourse. The fact of the matter is that once humans regularly walk a path, tigers generally avoid it. Our guide showed us many forms of flora and fauna in the forest, spiders, leeches, Wild fowl, Cobra shaped huge tree, strangulated fig trees which were amazing. We were able to get close camera shots of Kingfisher bird and few other rare birds. I saw for the first time, 10-15 frogs jumping in the river for breathing air for the first time. It was about a 3 kms walk for 2-3 hrs and was worth it!!"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Biting the hand that feeds iy,"Along with other non Indian tourists here we registered a complaint with the Forest dept, but they just don't care. Unfortunately the staff are mostly surly,uncommunicative, unhelpful and sometimes downright rude. The park administration is a disaster. I had to ask twice for 300 rupees change in the forest office. It appeared that she hoped I would forget. Both the staff, the forest office and Periyar House hotel gave us incorrect information on important issues, on more than one occasion. The water level is so low at the moment that any boat activity is compromised. The rafting was a shambles - we kept getting stuck on underwater tree stumps and hardly went any distance at all. We did see elephants on the walk to the rafts and back. Take some food with you. The nature and green walks go through the woods, but no wild life to see beyond monkeys. The website did not work so we could not book online. Booking when we got here was stressful. You have to pay per day to be in the park and we had to get tuk tuk out each day to book things and go rafting. The highlight was boat trip at 3.30 when we did see bison, samba and otters. Many more Indian tourists are going to the park, so maybe they can get across the message that should not treat tourists with the contempt they do now."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Early morning trip,We visited the wildlife sanctuary early morning. There are plenty of guides on board who are really helpful and willing to point out all the wildlife. The guides will also take the photos for you getting some fabulous shots. The tour takes about an hour and a half and is well worth the early morning start.
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Super Flop and waste of Time,This is one of the ugly place where couples should not waste their time et all...Absolutely pathetic with just hype of animals...u can hardly see a sambhar or a bison...unnecessary waiting in queue everywhere with non corporate officials..
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Just about OK,"With kids under 13yo, we weren't really eligible to go anywhere. The rush caused the jeep safaris bookings to close. We ended up having to do a ""PugMark Trail"" which lasted about an hour max which was OK. Nothing to write home about but inside the forest area periphery.  Most locals say you hardly ever spot a tiger and apparently there are only 43 of them (I have no way to verify this number.)  Try and find your own way with google maps. Asking anyone would lead to a commission which is charged to the service provider and ultimately you pay for it.  Since we were only doing the ""PugMark"" trail, no one was interested to entertain us as the cost was cheap but then what you experience isnt all that great either."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Getting close to nature and the wild,"The Periyar Wildlife sanctuary is one of the biggest attractions of Thekkady. This sanctuary is a dense forest with many wild animals. Its not easy to spot these animals as they generally avoid humans. One nice way to go around the park is to go for the boat ride inside the sanctuary. You will be able to catch the Bison, wild boars, water birds and deers. Tigers and Elephants are hard to find. Its also a wonderful place for plant lovers. There is an entry fee to get into the sanctuary and it also includes a fee for the vehicle. The ticket counter closes around 5 pm and hence be there on time. There are also some trekking trips organized everyday.  One of the best ways to enjoy this wonderful forest is to stay in one of the hotels situated inside the sanctuary."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Foreigners ripped off,"We decided to take the half-day trekking and bamboo raft tour and were only disappointed that we did not see any elephants. We did, however, see bison, wild dogs, wild pigs, many lovely birds and enjoyed it very much  The price of the tour was reasonable as it included breakfast, as well as three knowledgeable guides. What annoyed, however, was the additional cost to enter the sanctuary. Indians pay 35 rupees but foreigners have to pay 450 rupees - hardly encouraging foreign tourism, you may think!"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Whilst a beautiful scenic location, not many animals to see",Beautiful wildlife park. Too many visitors and as a result the animals hide away. It is worth visiting just for the lovely boat trip but you dont need more than a day here as there really is nothing to see or do unless you like moneys as there were loads of these running around.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great wilderness but lacking in basic comforts.,"Lots of trekking through the park and plenty of wildlife. Guides were good. Weren't expecting the basic bedding (thin foam mat & unclean nylon sleeping bag with no inner sheets), and no personal washing facilities (had to wash with toilet flush bucket in toilet). No paper napkins, toilet paper or soap provided. Food basic but plentiful."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,life in other forms,"would be a good place for everyone, particularly for children from 4 years to 20 years. we could not see many wildlife as we could in Sanjay Gandhi park in Mumbai"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great Place and prestine nature,Thekkadi is a great place and a must visit for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts. great evening life and nice restaurants offering authentic local cuisines. Minimum stay suggested 2-3 days to explaore and enjoy.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worth a visit,This is a very scenic place and nice visit with family. Unfortunately our visit was after heavy rains season so water levels were high so could not see the animals. Best time would be before the rainy season when animals come out in the open area not covered by trees to drink water. Worth visiting for the natural beauty and being close to nature.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Must visit,"Everyone must visit Periyar wildlife sanctuary at least once. It is beautiful. It is maintained by the government so you got to follow their rules.  They provide an array of activities within the sanctuary - Day and night treks with a guide through the forest, boating in the Periyar lake (It is better to book tickets online for the boat else you will have to stand in line for hours to get a ticket). They also offer bamboo rafting and a few other activities.  If visiting Periyar, I would recommend to spend at least 2 days there especially if you are interested in exploring nature and wildlife or in photography. Try to get an accommodation within the sanctuary eg. Kerala tourism resort which is besides the Periyar lake. Residents of KTDC don't have to get tickets for boat as they are complementary."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Disappointed,Very much disappointed with we could not manage to get the tickets very crowd early morning itself we checked out the hotel by 6 am again we not get the tickets
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worst tour of my life,"I visited in January 2016. There are no animals except some grazing cows. Guide, driver, organizer try to fool you all the time by saying, that there is an elephant and you wont see anything. He will keep fooling you by saying that he can see the animals beside grass or on a hill by a naked eye, which you cant even see with a binoculars..... Worst ever tour of my life. Exobitant charges. They charged me 3000 for nothing. Dont ever visit Thekkady or Periyar wild life."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Lucky to be seeing wildlife,THE Timing is a problem and the limited boating services makes a trip risky to get through. Advance booking of boat ride is advised not to be disappointed when you are there
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Poorly managed park,"The park is not suitable for overseas travellers. Poorly managed facilities with Inadequate customer service. Stay away, there are many better places you could be."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A beautiful trekking!,We booked a full day bamboo rafting which was amazing. We had a good bunch of people along with us which made it even better. Staff is very courteous & helpful. You shouldn't definitely opt for this when you visit Thekkady.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,SCENIC AND CAPTIVATING,"Thekkady is not just to see elephants. It offers a marvelous panorma of flora and fauna, that enchants even ordinary tourists"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Awesome,"Hi,it was my third trip to Periyar wildlife honestly I am truly in love with this place, A) Periyar reserve night trail,here they take you inside the jungle where you have to walk for atleast 3 to 4 hours,here you have opportunity to sight some animals like elephant,bison,deer,owl and many more,they have two timing for the trail one starts at 10 and second At 1am both have the high chances to sight animals,my advice carry some good night batteries to make it more wonderful  B) same place you can go for nature trails during the day time,but less chances to sight animals"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worth a visit,Visited in November 2016 during our Kerala trip. The forest area is quite well protected and tree foliage is dense and varied. We tried for the boat ride but luck ran out as tickets got over by the time we reached. The water level was low and the feedback we heard from other tourists was that they could not see many animals except bison. Nice place to visit
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nothing out of the ordinary,"We were in Periyar in November, still knowing that it is not the best time to see animals. It cost a lot of money the entrance, plus the bamboo rafting tour. The tour was too long, we walked for several hours, paddled for several more hours, walked more... We were offered breakfast and lunch, but it was too hot to spend the whole day there. I think a 9 hour excursion is excessive. We only saw elephants at the end of the tour, in the distance, and very close to the entrance. We are not sure if it was worth so much money and time."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Quite an interesting place to visit,We didn't get to see animals here.. Maybe its not the right time to visit. Will certainly do this trip again next time
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Amazing National Park,"The boat ride is the highlight of the sanctuary We were not lucky enough to see the elephants, could manage only few birds and bison."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,A tiger reserve,"wonderful sanctuary with lots of wildlife which are healthy and comfortable , from their ethological observations.larger mammals and smaller mammals are in plenty and its a professionally managed sanctuary Kerala Forest Department can be proud of.Tiger population is the best and as a predator they have all territorial comforts here ..sighting depends on your luck .the flora and fauna of Periyar are well documented."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Best place to visit,People who intend to visit it must online book their tickets in season time. Its one of the most facinating rides. For nearly 1.30hr one gets to see the wild animals in their natural habitat. Must visit place.
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Overhyped and expensive,"We travelled all the way from Munnar and reached thekkady at 1 pm. We visited this place by 2.45 pm. Spent surround 4k for seeing wildlife which was told to us but we never spot an animal here. Just simply avoid wasting time, money and energy. The driver was honest enough to tell us that, that the last time he saw any animal (elephant) at all in the drive was a year back, and never after.  We wound up paying about 4K for a drive in the jeep only hoping to be lucky. We stopped at certain points where there were tons of other jeeps too waiting to spot an animal. It was scenic and nice .. we clicked pics .. but that's that.  We saw a bison about 100kms away on top of a mountain, it looked like an small dot on my camera but we were made to believe that they are bisons.  So not recommended friends."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Bamboo Rafting and walk through the wildlife sanctuary,"The walk through the jungle was amazing. The guides were very helpful. They told us about the various trees that were growing in the forest. We got to see black monkey, mongoose and few wild dogs during our walk. Walking through the dense forest was very peaceful. On our return, we got to see few elephants too in the wild. Must visit"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,The safari is a fleece,"You would never spot an animal here. Just simply avoid wasting time, money and energy. We woke up at 4 in the morning, got into the jeep and off to the Periyar wildlife sanctuary. The driver was honest enough to tell us that, that the last time he saw any animal (elephant) at all in the drive was a year back, and never after.  We wound up paying about 4K for an early morning drive in the jeep only hoping to be lucky. We stopped at certain points where there were tons of other jeeps too waiting to spot an animal. It was scenic and nice .. we clicked pics .. but that's that.  We saw a bison about 100kms away on top of a mountain, it looked like an ant but we were made to believe that they are bisons.  So not recommended friends."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wildlife,"I made a 3 hours trekking with a guide. This park is huge, has more than 100 species of animals but rare to see them. I was lucky to spot wild elephants. At the entrance you can see monkeys."
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Do Not Waste Money Its Fraud,"These kind of Safaris are there in and around Thekkady. I had booked one of them called 'Thekkady Jeep Safari'  Price for hiring the Jeep is 3500/-, due to absence of information one assumes that it will have at least some element of thrill and will come across animals. As per the Organisers the safari is for three hours and chances of you coming across number of animals are bright. However, the Safari finished in 2 hour and 45 minutes, out of which around 40 minutes are taken to reach the forest area one way (total approx 80 minutes). During rest of the time, you are taken to 2-3 points and chances of your coming across any animal are actually not very bright. We did not see any animal except two Bisons seen at a distance of 4-5 kilometres on a hill - we actually could not make out much out of it except vaguely through zoom of the camera. Only thing which we could see was few cows near the villages. Actually they take you only in the periphery of forest only around the villages.  Overall NOT recommended. Its actually a jeep ride and a fraud going on in the name of jungle safari."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Early morning boat ride preferred for citing animals,"Tigers are not visible in complete reserve ! It's 101% by luck to sight a tiger.  You can surely experience groups of elephants, deers, birds, etc  Not recommended to take kids along (age1 to 5yrs) or if you take along try to keep them quiet to enjoy the boat ride.  Do not carry food along as monkeys around all over and shall jump over you if they catch you having food."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Don't hope too much,We took the 3;30 PM cruise. First of all the hype created around the boat ride was total worthless. You can buy tickets online or get in the que to buy tickets. Keep the main gate entry ticket for getting the boat tickets. The boat was ride was nice and scenic subject to no expectation attached. You see usual animals very very far. Even my telescopic lens could not catch. Do be honest nothing great what so ever.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,its simply awesome... A lake on the Hill with age old Forest and the existence of the Wildlife,"its simply awesome... A lake on the Hill with age old Forest and the existence of the Wildlife. I have seen Elephants, Deers, Wild Bores , Bisons and so many birds in this Sanctuary ."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worth the wait,The long check in process to board the tourist vessel that takes you around this lake is almost enough to make you turn around and go back home. Average wait time is 90minutes and the boat trip is about the same length of time. However if you are lucky enough to see wildlife (by no means guaranteed) then the waiting is worthwhile.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wonderful morning cruse,"We went on a morning cruse around the lake, it was magnificent. The guides were good at pointing out wildlife and, although we had no elephants, there were many other interesting things to see."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Amazing experience,"We spent three days exploring the reserve and we had an awesome experience.  1) Boating: We went for boating twice once in the morning and other in the evening. Both times we were lucky to spot animals. Bisons, samba deer, barking deer, elephants, wild dogs, otters, wild pig and many birds. The lake is very beautiful and since we went in oct the weather was also very pleasant.  2) Jungle scout : This is a 3 hour walk in the forest at night. It was an amazing experience for us and were able to spot deers, bisons, porcupine and rabit. We also had a close encounter with a bison which was trying to run away and missed us by few feets.  3) Nature walk : Nature walk is in a 3 hour walk thought the forest area near the lake. We went at 2.30pm. There were some breath taking sceneries near the lake. We even spotted a baby elephant, deer, amd bison gracing together. We spotted Nilgiri langurs, red necked mangoose, and many birds.  4) Green walk: It is 3 hour walk though the forest but not near the lake. We spotted lot of different types of birds. Many spots were very beautiful.  To enjoy the trip completely there are few this things one has to be careful about  First thing is to book tickets for all the programs like boating, nature walk, green walk and jungle scout online in advance. Booking ticking after reaching the sanctuary can be very difficult with long lines and also it is very unlikely to get a ticket too. Plan your programs and book the tickets online before hand and you can enjoy the trip to the fullest.  Second thing to know is that sighting animals is just a chance. So more the number of programs you book greater are your chances to sight animals.  Thirdly thing to know is to have a binocular with you if possible (which we did not have). Especially during the boat rides binoculars can come in very handy.  Fourth and final thing is to try and reach the sanctuary early before any program starts. The traffic outside the gate can be very heavy and one can get stuck there for 30 to 45 min. So consider that time too to reach for your programs"

40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wildlife,"Spotting wildlife depends on ur luck.. we spotted deers, pigs n bison... U need a good eye to spot wildlife!"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not very attractive for people who want to watch animals.,Animals are very rare sight. You can easily see elephants and Deers. But don't expect more. Single Visit is recommended for hard core nature lovers.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,A walk on the wild side,"We did a 2.5 hour trek through the Periyar National Park one morning & enjoyed being so close to nature. You have to book in advance & its best to do the early morning walk which starts at 7am & finished around 9.30. The guide we had was knowledgeable & pointed out many intetesting flora/fauna as well as various birds. We came across samba deer, monkies and some magnificent wild elephants. We also encountered leeches which fortunately were not too much of a problem as we were given protective gear to wear & the guide sprinkled tobacco powder on our shoes & pants which repel the leeches. Alas - no tiger sightings but overall a very enjoyable visit."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful Sanctuary. Nature is awesome inside,"Bison, Dear, Wood pecker, Horn bill, Racket tail Drongo, Wild bore, we have seen. But the nature is beautiful inside. Calm, silent and slow ride of 2 hrs in still water. Peace of life."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good !!,The wildlife sanctuary is to be seen sitting on a boat.The duration was of nearly 2 hrs.We went early morning so weather and surroundings was good.Could see many wild animals and birds.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,nice view,The ride in the boat for 2 hours was good.We saw different types of wild animals. But the park was crowded due to Onam's public holidays
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Border hike is great!,"I did the border hike on a rainy day in August. We didn't get to see any elephants or tigers, but the hike was still beautiful with many sightings of birds, some deer and monkeys."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Totally mast place,I really liked the placed.Went there with family.Its was beautiful trip and place is very nice although it took long time to take ticket.Saw elephant and moving in Jungle but sad part is that we have seen Tiger there.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Ferry Safari was awesome,"Book the Ferry online in Advance and also go for the morning as well as the evening rides, you may even spot tigers if you are lucky!"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Amazing Serenity,"One of most beautiful and serene place that I have ever visited. Visiting Kerala and not visiting this sanctuary is a sin in itself. Its not about spotting a tiger or for that matter, any other animal, visiting it is an experience in itself. ""Awesome"" is the first word that came to my mind, when I first saw the glimpse of the lake inside the sanctuary. The only big mistake I made was not booking the ferry service online. there are long queues with less probability of getting a ticket if we are slightly late in reaching there. There is nothing much interesting to do rather than the attending the nature walks, boating and the night camps organised by the authorities.You can't help but remember those so huge and long trees throughout your life."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Enjoying the Jeep Ride,"The best time to go hunting for wildlife is 5.30 in the morning, or else you would see nothing but greenery scenary  There are animals, but they're like really far on top of the hills. If you really want to get closer to the animals, my advice is book for an early jeep ride.  Nonetheless, the view is awesome. I do enjoy this more than Houseboat Backwater :) and I wish I stay longer in Thekkady for more activities"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Just Periyar Sanctuary - No Wildlife,"In fact, we can remove wildlife from the name. Just 54 tigers in an area of ~980 sq.kms. And you can at max see wild boars during the jungle trek, and if you are really lucky, you can see elephants (mostly in summer). You can’t even dream of seeing a tiger there in any season.  If you are going there to see wildlife, better drop the plans and visit Bandipur or nearby sanctuaries. If you are nature lover, then you can think of this place. Otherwise, it is not worth to cover this place during Kerala trip.  Better opt for normal boat ride than bamboo rafting if you are sick of walking 11kms (to and fro) in jungle, again don’t expect to see any animals."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not sure you see tiger,Good for sight seeing and photos we have not seen the wild animals just saw some elephants not much to enjoy only thing to enjoy is the Jeep ride
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Clean forest with unique birds and common zoo animals,"Not so great oppurtunity visiting the place. Saw a few animals like sambar, bison, kingfisher, ducks, tortoise, snake, but missed the main animals like tiger, elephants, etc not so important location to spend for a night stay visitors can avoid it and have other activities and places like boat rides to golden sand beach."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Sanctuary,"we had grt time in the middle of wildlife unfortunately we didnot find much animals still visit was superb in terms of view from boat , quality time spent"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Must Visit,"Its one of the best maintained widelife sanctuary in kerala.  Its great for boating , and nature hikes are also allowed.  Not at all advised for a rainy day."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,"The Tiger and Elephant Resere, the forest and the Lake - Really Great","Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary at Thekkady is worth visiting from the starting point - the drive through the forest, trekking and elephant ride inside the forest, boating through the Periyar lake and the scenic beauty... The authorities are strict regarding the trekking and elephant ride and also about the boating through the lake. They will explain to us about few previous accidents and it is better for us to go by their guidance mainly because of the safety factor. We could see many animals during trekking, elephant ride and boating and the trip was really enjoyable."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Excellent wildlife In periyar,"Periyar Tiger Reserve, Thekkady, is an example of nature’s bounty with great scenic charm, rich bio diversity and providing veritable visitor satisfaction.  One hour by boat tour is very calm, serene, and peaceful. I was able to enjoy all the green shades in the park. Also I saw deers, a buffalo, and some colorful birds. The boat tour is one hour. It is better to enjoy this tour if it is not raining. There is wonderful views inside the forest and along side lake. Walking to the boat ticket station is majestic full of old trees and different vegetation. Landscape is very nice. In summer time, you can see wild animals which will come to drink water."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,A Day in Periyar,"We were staying in Thekkady n started our journey at 6 am to periyar. Enjoyed the scenic ghat section in an open Jeep. Crossed thru tea, coffee estates, water crossing n finally reached the destination.  The package tour started with Breakfast.it was a nice breakfast at this altitude. Then view point visit with little trekking, boating and lunch done in random order to adjust with rain/fog.  Its recommended trip in Thekkady trip."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful boat scenic view,"One hour by boat is very calm, serene, and peaceful. It was not raining that day almost 11 am when I started. I was able to enjoy all the green shades in the park. Also I saw deers, a buffalo, and some colorful birds. The boat tour is one hour. It is better to enjoy this tour if it is not raining. Walking to the boat ticket station is majestic full of old trees and different vegetation. Landscape is very nice."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Tranquility and amazing landscape,"We took the early morning boat trip which was a lovely experience. Tranquility and amazing landscape. We were not very lucky with animal sitings but saw birds, bison, wild boar and a turttle."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Best place to enjoy the nature,"The place is best for its scenic beauty. Good place to roam with friends and family. Book your boat tickets online, or you may face a long queue. In summer time, you can see wild animals which will come to drink water."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,awesome river,"we enjoyed lot in Boat ride. breeze is awesome. We saw many animals like elephant, deers & variety of birds. Boat ride is more than one hour. only thing is we have to wait longer period for boat ride..other than it was nice experience."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great place for a weekend trip.,The place was cool and relaxing. Forest and lake. Don't miss the boat ride. They provide Elephant safari and forest trekking.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful example of preserving nature in Kerala,"Kerala is a beautiful state and its sad to see the devastation the lack of proper waste disposal and plastics have on nature in the state. However, at the reserve there is nothing but peace, calm and the beautiful nature that surrounds you. A great example of truly what can be done, if sufficient resource is poured into upkeep of our nature. There are toilet and seating facilities at the boat house jetty. Facilities were clean despite the rain. We then went on the boat trip around the lake and despite the rain saw Indian bisons, gaurs, sambhar deers, snake birds and hornbills. Beautiful! We had an excellent guide in our boat personnel and heard wonderful stories of tigers, elephants and leopards. Beautiful!"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Sighting wild life only with luck,"We , a family of four went for half day Bamboo rafting , which actually more of trekking into so called reserve forest 5 km each way . They charge 2000Rs per head . Considering a team of 5 locals including a guard accompany the touring party , the price may be justified. Those guys tell some stories about a tiger passed by leaving foot prints and scratch marks they left on trees etc . Considering that the route is pretty close to human habitat , it is very unlikely any real wild animals cross this route! They concluded that we were not lucky on that day and hence could not get to see elephants or any other animal!  They warned us on leaches and gave some special socks covering legs below knees and asked us to tuck pants into socks . They also dust the shoes with some powder to protect from leaches! Inspite of all these precautions, my wife got one of them on her stomach till the time we came to our hotel! The leach swelled into big size indicating the blood it sucked till then and fell on ground on its own! That is the only real threat I believe in this sanctuary as far as the tours they conduct  Leaving apart wild life, it is a good trekking experience if one can walk 10km. The package includes a lunch pack which is some bakery stuff with a fruit and a fruity kind of a drink .  There is a 30min boating which is bamboo rafting in the Periyar lake ! There a few unusual birds we could see and apart from that wonderful views inside the forest and along side lake ! Sounds by birds amidst absence of traffic is also a great experience!  Good for folks fit and interested in trekking without any expectations on sighting wild animals !"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worth a Visit,Its a long boat ride with awesome views waiting for a chance to see the wild animals but sadly couldn't but the view is awesome.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Gods own Country - Kerala,"Most beautiful, lush green forest and crystal clear water of lake is something which you will never forget. Boat ride in the lake in National park & wildlife sanctuary is a treat for eyes."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Taking a Chance,"Few would venture out in late June to enjoy this place. The place is almost free from crowds and the mornings pleasant, overcast with no showers. The boat ride is a pleasure: you woud spot a few monkeys,bison, nilgii and a possible elephant but all animal wild life is bonus and the real thing to enjoy is the nature at its best. Even this has a price No free lunches"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wildlife,"Very disappointed as we didn't get tickets to visit it, also came to know that there are hardly any animals in this forest."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,good place to visit for sighting of animals and boat ride.,"we had been to nature walk and also had a chance to see bison, nilgiri langoors, the grey hornbill, and above all a lone tusker just near the boat riding atart and end place at around 5.30 pm ."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Go only on off season,We went on thekkady on a christmas holidays and tourist people was everywhere. we did not get to chance for boating because availability of tickets. most of the programs we planned to go was not available because of more people
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful Sanctuary,"We went on a 3 hour trek, with the hope of seeing elephants. Sadly, we didn't see any, but it was a beautiful visit regardless. We did see some bison, and a mongoose. There were boat trips offered as well, which are most likely a great way to see the park, but the walk was lovely and serene and quite enjoyable."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Thick Forest view excellent from boating MINUS animals,We went for boating for morining first batch but even then did not find even a single animal except a Byson.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,One of the best in Kerala,Please visit this place and enjoy the untouched nature and beautiful greenery and great wild life.when ever i think of a tourist place in Kerala i have no dought to be in this place because you will feel the thrill of forest in this place.it have a an untouched wild life..please vist this place and try to be in for 2 to 3 days if you want to enjoy this place completely.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,nothing much to boast about,"Get your tickets online if it is a weekend or holidays, saves lot of time and hassle. Boat ride is good though water level has receeded a lot. could not see many animals only few migratory birds and sambars thats it.... Nothing special."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Absolute beauty,The place is freenish and little bit of cold air. The boating yard is full of monkeys and place is clean. Mostly recommended for a family visit. Boating costs Rs227.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice day,"This is nice for families too. Peaceful area with nature and also cabins to rent. We didn't stay here. Several boat trips on the lake, reserve online. Take you camera. Monkeys and elephants and more. Wear comfortable shoes. Great place to walk. Shady areas along much of the paths."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Where old primates meets new,"Saw a lot of common monkeys with identity crisis, exhibiting human behaviors seemingly expressing an innate desire to jump over the evolutionary hurdles. There were dark endangered monkeys too - those guys contented themselves by spitting seeds of wild fruits they ate on the road while people walked.  Saw a flying squirrel in action, as well as some introvert wild boars, who didn't stop to pose for the camera.  Trees were cool though. Almost all of them had mugshot name plates providing general information and a trivia (some of them really interesting, and some sugar coated, ridiculous stuff)  The boats were full when we got there, so we stood at the banks and watched buffaloes trying to figure out why humans took the trouble to see them from boats. Missed elephants, but their presence was wildly rumored by people who stood with us at the bank.  And artists! Plenty of artists came in with charcoal drawing exquisite pieces of art."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wonderful Place,Just few tips 1) Please book your tickets online in advance to save time 2) Best time to spot Elephants is morning time so try and book the first trip 3) No life jackets available for infants and small children on boat. Carry your own life jackets if travelling with small children.  Overall it is a fantastic experience.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,In the middle of the wildlife,Suggest to go very early morning as tickets are selling very fast and boating is only 4 or 5 times a day. You have to expect to stay at least one hour in the queue and be careful on monkies - coming from nowhere and stealing ;) I would enjoy this boating more if not storm and lightening but it is nature.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Boat ride in Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary,"It is important to book the ticket online for the boat ride. Online booking includes entry ticket to the park. The boat ride was very well organised. You can easily spot many bird species. During our trip, we could deers, yaks, wild boars, water dogs..."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Beautiful scenery, that's it","Should have made time to read the other trip advisor reviews about this sanctuary, but it was one component of our 60 day trip, and our itinerary said it was a two and a half hour drive. We would see tigers and elephants etc. Boat ride at 7.30am, quite beautiful scenery. We saw one bison in the distance and some otters, a few wild boar (needed field glasses to see them). Did see a kingfisher bird, otherwise egrets and cormorants) which we have at home. Personally we didn't find that a 10 hour round trip on winding roads worth the journey for a one and half hour boat ride to see scenery."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,very beautiful nature & jungle but no Animals,very beautiful nature & jungle is huge but no animals inside d jungle area if u like nature visit ds place there r no animals inside d jungle looks like wild animals r poached
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,just be one with the nature,"if you have spare time of 4 hours then visit this place otherwise dont spend time, instead explore other places."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Fantastic feel,"We took a short trek along a trail , met with some local hunters/ fishermen/women who were returning with their catch.A great feel to the place however the heat was something else as India was experinecing a heat wave [ 35"" degrees +]"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,The early morning walk,"We chose to take the 3 hour walk with guide. The guides are very smartly dressed and ours was extremely knowledgeable. Before we began the walk we signed a form agreeing we were capable of taking a walk of tedious nature. We crossed a ""shallowish"" stream by log raft. I felt intrepid. The aim was to see wild life before the local people came in to the area. We saw Elephant dung,then dung from an old elephant (food less well digested), porcupine dung, and the dung of numerous other creatures. We saw the shell of a Cicada and a single foot print near a drinking hole from a one legged hopping tiger. An absolute joy from the first moment to the last. Do go, you might even see some wild life. In fairness we did see and hear a Great Indian Hornbill which was a glorious experience. We would go again in a heart beat. Lovely morning."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Scenic beauty especially in rainy season,"The boat journey to the mullaperiar reservoir is a worthy on. Best time to catch up a boat is at 6.30 in than morning. The nature will be the most fabulous if it is raining...Wild boar, deer, wild buffalo, Elephants, tiger etc might be spotted"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Lovely boat cruise and scenic view,Periyar river boat cruise is the best part of Thekkadi visit. Early morning first trip is the best time and it is peaceful and offers scenic views. We could see only elephans and bisons. If you are lucky you may see more animals. It was memorable experience for us.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Go for the Night-time Treks,"The forest animals are more active at night, especially during the summer. The sanctuary offers treks at 7 PM, 10 PM and even 1 AM! We went for the 7 PM trek and really enjoyed the opportunity to see a mother & baby elephant, porcupines, and a sloth bear, along with deer and bison. We also went on a 3 hour day time trek which included a 30 min trip down the lake on a raft. These are much better experiences than the overcrowded and noisy boat trips."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Must Do Boat Cruise !!,Thekkady is incomplete without the boat cruise in the periyar lake. Book your boat ticket online as there is rush in the queues and the tickets are sold out quickly.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Superb,We had a great time enjoying the peaceful nature here. Saw lot of birds and animals. Definitely recommend this place.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wonderful experience...,"Boat riding in Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary is wonderful experience. We have to book atleast one day before for boat riding otherwise it is very difficult to get there. If you plan early morning, you can see animals while boating."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature at its best,"Have Visited this place 4 Times. There are 2 Resorts in the Forest & one on the Island. The Main attraction is the Periyar River/Lake. There is Well organised boat ride which takes you round the Lake. If you are lucky you can see Elephants, Sambar deer & Otters, Bison & many types of Birds. We were lucky to see a Tiger drinking water once. The Boat ride costs about Rs230 per head.Camera & Video cameras are charged extra. The Rooms in Aranya Nivas are large & Comfortable. Food very very good."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature at Best !!,This is an very peaceful place to visit with a rich variety of Flora and Fauna. The boat ride is very nice which takes you for a jungle Safari. One can spot Elephants and other animals.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT,"We took a boat ride on the lake at Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary. This was a peaceful experience mainly due to the sign saying ""no talking"". You'll most likely see evidence of tigers, elephants, samba deer, wort hogs, turtles and a myriad of different bird life. The highlight was the elephant at the waters edge stamping the water and waving it's trunk around ... remember these creatures are in a natural habitat."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,"great boat ride and jungle trek with official trained guide, ample sighting of wild animals","We enjoyed the great boat ride and jungle trek with official trained guide, ample sighting of wild animals. A photographer's paradise. The boat ride can be a day activity, or you could stay at Lake Palace KTDC inside the sanctuary and enjoy the tranquil evening, and do the trek in the morning."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Crowded and noisy,we saw no animal and the place was crowded. The boat trip was noisy and no announcement were made . Not really interesting apat from the view
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Diverse and Interesting. Lots of wildlife,"My wife and I went for the afternoon walk in the reserve. I was not expecting too much but was pleasantly surprised with the variety and amount or wildlife we saw on our walk. If you like walking and viewing birds, plants and animals this is a good place."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,You have to visit this- book in advance,"You have to visit this- book in advance.  It was so worth the visit, so much to see from the boat and the guides and rangers are so helpful. Too much to say just take in the scenery and the wildlife- The highlight for us was we managed to see wild elephants crossing the lake. Mum, Dad, a teen and a baby, just amazing."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Late afternoon walk and boat ride,"Entrance for foreign travellers to the Park is higher cost than locals. It is about a 4km walk from entrance to boat jetty. I was lucky to get a ticket for the boat (last trip of the day) at 3:30pm. Seats are assigned. It was very busy with Indian tourists who were visiting for the weekend. We saw a small family of wild elephants close up by the lake, herds of bison and deer. It was a surprisingly enjoyable and fun given some bad reviews."
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,A bad experience,"We were sold jeep safari tickets to see the wild life in the park. The tickets were £35 each and the trip consisted of being picked up at 5.30 am and being driven for about an hour and a half during which time we saw 5 monkeys, some supposed bison in the distance a and an elephant foot print. We arrived at the ranger office and were given breakfast which took an hour and a half. Our ticket then entitled us to a half hour walk up a hill to look at the view. A rowing boat ride to see a waterfall, a trip to a cardamom factory with nothing I. It and a museum with a half painted elephant skeleton. Lunch was also included. The trip ended 2 hours before it should have and on the way back we saw 4 cows and a wild chicken. It was. A complete waste of time and money."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Quietest place in india,"As this park closes after 5pm the peace and quiet were a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the trip. Although we did not see a wild tiger( A very rare occurrence) the guides were excellent in spotting monkeys , and wild elephant and bison herds,as well as pointing out the rare bird and plant species."
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar Wildlife Animal Sanctuary with No Wildlife Animals,"Periyar Wild Life Sanctuary Boat Timings: 07:00; 09:30; 11:30; 14:00;16:00; hrs. There is No advance ticket booking for boating at Thekkady; the guest should take tickets directly on arrival. Kindly cross check the boat timings once you reach as it may change; since only a few boats are available for cruise at Thekkady. We reached Thekkeday at 01.30 PM and we were informed that all the boats were full and there is no tickets availability for the day. We were informed that next day ticket counter opens at 6.20 AM where uyou have to stand in queue and book ticket. Next day we reached at 6.00 AM and there was huge line for buying of tickets. The ticket cost is around Rs 75 for adults and 33 for children (5-11 years) , I f you have your own vehicle you need to pay Rs 75 extra to enter inside the park. Once enter, you need to cross approx 2.5 km inside the park for another ticket counter. Since there are only 300 seats available for the boats, people were rushing, running for the same. There also u need to pay for another ticket. Each ticket is numbered as per the seating arrangement inside the boat. The entire boat ride inside the jungle was for two hours. We hardly saw any wild animal except for three kingfishers, one stork and one unidentified bird. , Scenic view inside was great. But its a waste of time if you are wildlife lover and u would definitely be disappointed if you are not able to spot any animal"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,jungle resort,I stayed in Forest Canopy in Kumily near periyar sanctuary. A nice jungle resort newly built . A must for nature lover
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not much animals to see,The boat ride costed us 180 rs per head and we only spotted birds and monkeys. It;s not that worth time and money
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful place to visit,"The sanctuary is a big place, of which we visited the lake part. Despite not knowing the local language, we were helped by few people in filling up form and engaging in discussion. We had an awesome time"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Even though the nature was at its best, the authorities simply dont match up to those standards.",".As the name suggests this is supposed to be a tiger reserve, but we could not spot a single tiger during our boat ride.Well I for one thought what are we paying Rs.225/- per head for.When u look at the area and the waters before entering the boat ride, u feel as if the boat ride is going to be restricted within a specific perimetre and u really don't fathom the length of the lake until u are inside the boat and sailing.The boat goes deep inside winding its way thru the never ending waters thru the wild life sanctuary.Even thought the view in to the dense forest and its lush green surroundings were scintillating, we were not fortunate to spot any elephants,but we saw plenty of bisons wild boars and a variety of birds sitting atop the cut trees protruding from the waters.The comfortable space created by nature for wild life to drink water, is simply great.Getting tickets during season will be a problem. There is no proper jetty.They must construct one for such a tourist spot.The entry in to the forest area should be free, as it is sheer waste of money.The vehicles should be allowed to go right up to the boating area.Currently we have to walk quite a distance right up to the boating area."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Expectations belied,"Great potential but mismanaged. No proper infrastructure. No proper jetty. Huge monkey menace. In the Restaurant which anyways is absolutely unhygienic, It seems like you are in the cage and the monkeys are watching you from outside. The boat ride was nothing great. We did see elephants, deers and wild boars. Would I go back? NO"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful sanctuary,"Its a beautiful sanctuary! The boat ride is cool, however getting ticket for it could be very challenging specially during peak season."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,"A wonderful morning with birds, dear and wild goar","We did a guided walk through the park with a park service employee. He told us the history of the place and what types of birds and animals we were seeing. We thoroughly enjoyed our two hour walk and saw many animals - no tigers though! I suggest going in the early morning as it is cooler, and the numbers of animals and birds is greater."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Park visit,"Interesting trip if expensive for boat ride as due to the dry climate and low water levels very little to see and at quite a distance from boat, would need a minimum of 200mm lens to take worthwhile photos."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A vast sanctuary,The entire place is shaded and very vast. The foliage is thick and the trees are amazingly tall. A well maintained clean place and you can roam around liesurely
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,excellent morning lake cruise,Went on the first cruise of the day which I think is best because of the cooler temperature. we saw everything we wanted to except for tigers. the guys on board were great spotters and know how to use every camera out there.
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,3 hour jeep safari - stay away!,"Not sure if this review belongs on this particular site but want to alert readers to a 3 hour jeep safari sold in town. A driver picks you up at your hotel at 5:30 am for a 30 minute ride to the reserve - there is a short drive around a portion of the outer boundary of the reserve but no chance to actually see any animals other than domestic cattle and dogs. We were back at our hotel by 8:00 am. The ""jeep safari"" is sold as a chance to view wildlife but the only wildlife you will see is one that wanders into this section by accident. Do not waste your money on this activity!"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Just go for a stroll,"We spent a couple of hours on a hot day which was lovely and cool. Many birds, monkeys, Indian squirrels, deer and great trees to see. Just go for a pleasant walk."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Excellent day trekking and bamboo rafting,"Quite a demanding day setting off early morning to trek through the sanctuary for a couple of hours spoting game, birds and signs of tiger activity in a recent kill and pug marks. The group of 9 had a guide with a rifle and a couple of trackers. A bit disconcerting to put on canvas sock/legging for protection against leeches (and probably unnecessary as the ground was pretty dry). We rafted on large bamboo rafts with water lapping through before another hike spotting wild elephant and signs of leopard before a rest break for lunch. More rafting and a two hour hike back to the lodge meant a 9-10 hour quite demanding day. Very enjoyable to get out into the wild with few other people about."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not worth spending your time,To keep it simple and short..... You will have a boring boat ride to see few animals.... Not at all worth doing.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,long boat tour less animals,"The lake is beautiful and so is the boat tour. To get more from the sanctuary suggest you should go for the KTDC's night or eco tours. the details are on their website. If you like staying with the nature, KTDC has 3 properties in sanctuary itself with camping options. Do check those out."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar,Very Good sanctuary but can be maintained more. There were lot of monkeys so don't take any eatable items with you not even a water bottle. Jetty was not very good since temperature was too high.Didn't encounter any wild animal except Elephant.
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Tourist trap,"This part of our Journey could have totally been skipped. The town is large, busy and loud as most larger Indian cities however, the Periyar Sanctuary pales in comparison to so many others around the world. The only thing you will see here is: lineups, monkeys and hoards of people. You will not see: Tigers or Elephants or exceptional views. The boats have ludicrous wait times and the Indian people have started touring their own country quite a bit themselves so there are just heaps of people waiting to get on this tin can that goes (literally) up one small channel and back down the other side of it."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Walking trek with a guide,"We did the early morning walk with a guide near the lake. We were knitted out with thick gaiters and had to be pulled across a part of the lake whilst balancing on a bamboo raft. As with all walks you may be lucky to see a variety of wildlife and may not. We were, and apart from numerous birds and monkeys we saw wild dogs eating a kill, gaur, mongeese, and wild elephants."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,peaceful journey,even though we were unable to spot any animal the journey was quite soothing and calm.best time to visit is morning and evening
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Enjoy the beatiful forest,"We did two half day tours of the forest, the bamboo rafting and another walk. We had very good guides. Don't expect to see elephants, since they are too dangerous to come near, but enjoy the forest and the knowledge of the guides. And keep quiet. We were lucky to see elephants because they came down to the lake."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,it is nice,wildlife sanctuary is a beautiful place.. but i suggest you to go early morning to have the thrill of watching animals closely
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Silent peaceful boat journey in Nature !!,"Do not expect to see any animal other than Langur there :)  Having said that if you look forward to a peaceful walk in the greens its a good place to be. The road towards the boat ride is laden with green trees. Take an early morning boat ticket and witness the sweet chirping of birds in the morning!  The boat tickets can be bought online or ask your hotel guy to arrange. I stayed in Veddanta, which took care of the booking, costed me around 300. With online booking options available, its easier to get a ticket.  The boat is taken on a one hour tour inside the sanctuary where you witness jungles on both the sides, its a view to hold :) Try taking seats in the upper deck of boat, gives a better view.  Go for the sea and jungle ..! :)"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful nature park,Take a ticket at the main gate and walk the 3 kms to the boating area...Beautiful. Drivers drive too fast. Understand they plan to close this road for vehicular traffic - some time in future. till it happens its noisy. There are plenty of trails if one is interested to walk. The 90 minutes boat ride is well worth it. Seeing any animal depends on your luck. Locals say the best opportunity is riding on the first or the last boat. We took the last boat and were lucky to see many animals including about 10 elephants.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nothing to do with kids :(,"The only thing you can do with kids under 12 is a barge/boat trip for 1 hour. We saw birds and deer, but that was it; the boat was very large and full. We took the last boat of the day and even the gift shop shut down before we returned. If you want to do anything in Thekkady, plan days ahead and don't bother bringing kids. We were disappointed to arrive, having 3 days there, and not be able to do a single trek in the Sanctuary or around."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature at its best,- Awesome place to visit with loved one - Best for wildlife photography - Booking will start at very early morning - Walk around 1km from main gate to boating area. - Thrilling experience - Carry DSLR or atleast Binocular to watch the forest animals
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Enjoyable 3-hour Nature Walk in the Sanctuary,"We booked and enjoyed the 10 am. nature walk through the forest in the park and along the lake with a park ranger. We enjoyed the trek very much and the knowledge of the ranger of the forest plants, trees, birds and animals. We went, not expecting to see much wildlife, but for the exercise. We experienced both. We saw many monkeys, wild boars, some bison, parrots, bee-eaters, and many water fowl. An added bonus, was crossing the arm of the lake on a reed raft with a rope pulley. One has to make the booking at least one day prior to the trek, then get the park pass on the day of the visit before going to the sanctuary. It is a great alternative to the boat rides offered in the park."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worth getting up at sunrise!,"We visited here and were not disappointed! We had an initial float across the lake on a bamboo raft and then into the forest. We managed with the help of our guide to see mongoose ( 3 of them!) hornbills,kingfishers, deer , buffalo and to our great delight a small herd of elephants with their young! We spent 3 hours in the early morning which we think is best as the animals naturally retreat to the forest during the heat of the day.our guide was an absolute delight and very knowledgable."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worth the visit!!!!!!!!!!!!,Perfect place for the nature lover. neat and clean place. some deer monkey wild buffalo and giant squirrels were spotted.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wild Elephant spotted on a well organised tour,"We took the half day bamboo rafting trip, which involved a few hours of trekking through the forest to a leisurely bamboo raft from where you have the best chance of seeing wildlife.  Our guides, with about 10 years combined experience, have only spotted tigers three times in their time, so do not go there with high hopes. Still the chance keeps you on your toes and the armed guide makes for a great photo, if nothing else.  We saw three types of monkey, squirrels, an elephant having a drink in the lake and a herd of bison... not to mention the wild chicken! Not a bad morning for wildlife spotting at all.  Website booking is a nightmare. Took way longer than it should have."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,A wildlife Sanctuary that is truly wild!,"Visitors can spend a day or a week in the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary as there is much to see and do...from, boat rides, to hikes to camping to incredible sightseeing. There is wildlife galore for those willing to take the time to experience that this national park has to offer...enjoy!"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,lovely place very wild and authentic wildlife experience,"great time we had at this wildlife sanctuary,.reasonably clean and nice I would highly reccomend it if you are going to thekkady."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Diffrent and best experience,Periyar was one of my best events. All the forest is covered with water and safari is by Boat. Superb Experience.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Fantastic experience,"We took the last trip of the day and it was well worth the wait. Our guides with their eagle eyes spotted loads of animals as we floated by and took loads of photos on our behalf. Then all of a sudden a family of four elephants were at the waters edge waiting to swim across, which they did as soon as we passed. An awesome experience."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful flora and fauna!,"Speaking of Periyar Reserve itself - the forests and the lake are absolutely magnificent and deeply beautiful - especially if you are a nature lover and recognise the uniqueness of this ecology. We did two things at periyar - the one day border trek & the morning boating at periyar lake.  The Border Trek: The Periyar website was down and it took quite an effort to actually book this space through multiple calls and what not. We wanted to book the bamboo rafting package but unfortunately, limited spaces meant it was already booked out. So, recommend booking your trek packages much earlier. We were six people on the trek and apparently, Indians don't trek too much so we were a bit of a novelty - especially for a day long trek. We had one guard and two helpers with us and truly wished that these very nice and helpful men were more trained in recognising the flora and fauna of the region. Their knowledge was limited to the large animals and hence, the whole trek was concentrated in finding only the elephants and bisons. There were barely any stops and the constant trudging scared the numerous birds, butterflies and monkeys hovering about. Still I did manage to spot the elephants, the malabar hill squirrel (three!), wild hogs, sambars, black langurs, splendid number of birds (the malabar trogan was a special treat!) - evidence to the richness of Periyar. With training and some thought, this could be a much better curated, informed and quieter trek. Not being seasoned trekkers we also struggled with the pace and lack of stops. The food seemed to try hard to cater to the western palate and was rather insipid - they should stick to what they make well in India one feels. Also, while one sees the use of the leech and muck protection socks provided by the guards - they need to be in various sizes. My feet were utterly cramped thanks to the huge sock i tried tucking into my little shoe. If you can, wear roomy sturdy shoes or be prepared for blisters.  The periyar 7:30am boating: This is an absolutely hilarious and potentially frustrating experience. One has to be at the gates by 5:30am to be ready to compete for a spot on the morning trip. Cars lined up the narrow Kumily streets and then broke into a mad dash to get to the second gate; people got off and then ran again to the booking building! One felt one was in some form of an obstacle race. I'm sure with some thought this could be better managed! Carry a pen coz you have to fill a form. Being one of the few who had one - i was beseeched by desperate calls for pen all around! We got tickets (Rs.225 each) for the upper deck of the 7:30am trip. The lake is very picturesque with cormorants sunning their wings and nesting on solitary trees midst the expanse of the lake. We managed to spot the elephants, a huge hoard of boars, sambars - on the banks; and plenty of birds all around. Once people were seated it proceeded rather calmly and quietly and was well worth the initial mayhem. Post the boating, the space around the jetty was also amazing for bird watching - i spotted lots of minivets, a beautiful grey hornbill, racket tailed drongos - to name a few, even as the black langurs lazed around the tall treetops.  All in all, the place is beautiful but the management of these activities could be much improved. Definitely recommend a visit to nature lovers!"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Unless you want a boat ride, skip it!","Early morning run for the tickets, riding on overcharging autos inside the park, getting front row seats in an hour long boat ride - and then seeing only deer and bisons, is not really worth it. The basic purpose for visiting a national park like this is to sight a tiger, but not even once during the boat ride did we get to see anything that resembled a tiger. People got excited seeing an elephant on some distant meadows, or bisons on some distant hill and some deer running around. Giving 3 stars only for the greenery and natural beauty. The boat ride otherwise was a let down."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Ordinary Boating in name of Boat Safari,Frankly speaking not worth the effort & money. We went in January 2016 and there was hardly any sign of animals. May be in summer one may get better chance of viewing animals but I would any day suggest elephant safari is better option.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,All right parkvisit,"We took the bamboo rafting and hike for a whole Day . It was an ok trip- but very hot and exhausting, party because we lacked water. They shoud advise you to bring 2 liter og water- and the food was dreary-- Way NOT swap the cakes and White bread to a rice dish? More organic and tastier. The guides were kind- but please tell groups to be quiet and dont talk and talk."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Morning safari with the lads,With no expectation of seeing any wildlife we had an excellent morning in the landrover up and down the hills - scary at times but very good value. Excellent trip and a break from the cycling.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good Walking but the Interesting Animals are Elusive,"Buying tickets for trips takes a little patience as the staff are not very forthcoming with information. The full day border walk is good if you want some decent exercise but you're unlikely to see elephants. Good views, guides and packed meals. The boat trips on the lake look very touristy and busy with little chance of seeing any interesting animals."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful forest,We visited this place in Dec 2015. The forest is clean and well maintained. We stayed inside the forest in a KTDC hotel. The main attraction here is the periyar lake boating.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful but overcrowded and overpriced,The entrance fee for foreigners is 450 rupees which is very expensive if you consider that UNESCO listed monuments cost 250rs. Still this hefty price allows you only to enter the reserve all activities need to be paid separately. The boating on the lake is disappointing as the ferry is packed with tourists. It's much more enjoyable to take a guided walk especially in the morning when the park is not yet overcrowded with local visitors (the old forest is splendid) Though I think in general it is overpriced and you can find better places to enjoy truly unspoiled nature in Kerala than Thekkady.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Best place to enjoy wilderness amidst gods own country,Periyar wild life Sanctuary is one of the best place to hang out and enjoy wilderness amidst gods own beautiful country. If not tiger then atleast you would surely get a glimpse of Elephant Family N many more wild animals.  One can enjoy boat ride or night walk or both based on his her interest. Tickets can be taken in advance from counter near to Lake or from the ktdc resorts.
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Expensive and highly commercial,"More of a drive through woodland park that provides limited opportunities for enjoying both floral and fauna.  Guided walk a little better but highly commerical and had the feeling of a production line due to bumping into several other groups whilst in the forest - even though the high cost of the tour (in addition to paying for park access, then again for your vehicle ) is supposed to provide individual and exclusive time slots in order to reduce environmental impact. Therefore comes across as a bit of a scam."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful early morning boat trip,"Quiet and peaceful early in the morning, the waters of the lake still giving a breathtaking view of a undisturbed reflection! Spotted a dear at the edge of the lake and many bluebirds, absolutely beautiful."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Waste of time,"Not much to see on the 1 hour boat trip. Birds, wild pigs and deer. The most excitement was a man who yelled tiger! He's still sure he saw one but the guides on the boat told him it was a deer. The guides were nice took my camera and got pics of the wildlife, pretty birds etc. I'm from WI in the U.S. Tons of georgeous lakes and I've seen plenty of deer so this is just a time waster, so much more to see in beautiful India, I'd skip this. It's basically a ride on water."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Boat ride through Periyar sanctuary,"It is a regular boat ride but on a bigger boat with lot of co-travellers. The co-travellers are advised to maintain decorum and so the ride is pleasant, however do not expect to see a lot of exotic wildlife."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Boat ride through the sanctuary,My number one tip is to get on the earliest boat possible - I believe it may be around 7:30am if you would like to see the wildlife. We were warned by our guide that it was a bit of a tourist trap and the ticket process is complicated.  Our boat ride was at about 11am and we didn't see anything except a few of the same bird.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Back Water Boat Ride.,The place was awesome. Scenic beauty was great. Had to wait a lot of time in the queue to get the boat ride ticket.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,superb place,must watch perriyal sanctuary as kerala is a right place for gods own country.best season jan - march
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar lake visit,Awesome experinec to enjoy the boat ride for 1.5hrs. Ideally try and catch the 1st boat ride if you want to see wild animals. Ofcourse you need to have some luck for that.  Overall a beautiful experience.!!!
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worth the effort,"My group of 6 pax had the benefit of a ""small"" group (just us) so the experience of the trail walk was more rewarding than having to cope with a load of other noisy strangers. The initial creek crossing on a rope driven bamboo raft was an interesting exercise in Health and Safety but no one fell in. Because Periyar is such a vast sanctuary, the chances of seeing any wildlife whilst on foot are unfortunately fairly low but there were monkeys in the trees and the bonus was an old female elephant grazing by the lake on the way back to the start point and the chance to brave a second raft crossing in order to get back to the Park HQ. Excellent Park Ranger made the visit worthwhile. Sensible shoes a must."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Awesome experience,Boating in the middle of periyar lake was next to awesome experience we had. we were lucky to get tickets as were the last one to enter. Place was really calm and pleasant to enjoy the nature and wildlife
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Border Walk Very Rewarding,"Today we took the guided ""border walk"" inside Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary. To take the walk (limited to two parties of six visitors daily) we bought a ticket in advance when we first arrived in Kumily. The tickets cost 2000rs each, and did not include the 450rs entry fee to the park. We met our guides at 8am, and were given gaitors to keep out leeches and burrs, a bottle of water, and a bag with breakfast and lunch. Our group had we two Americans, two German ladies, an Italian couple, and our three guides.  The hike starts level through the forest, where we saw a fair number of animals: monkeys (Nilgiri langur), fruit bats, a wild boar, some very large deer, and a whole bunch of bird species, including one hornbill. The guides were a little hard to understand at times, but they helped us spot the animals and pointed out what we were seeing along the way. We also liked that they told us about the plants we were seeing, such as banyan trees, sandalwood, cinnamon, wild ginger, wild pepper, and turmeric root. The trail eventually climbs a fair amount, first through forest and eventually on open ridges. The views from the top were nice, though it was kind of hazy. We did not see the big species (elephant, bear, tiger) but did see evidence of all three (lots of fresh bear scat, dried elephant dung, and one tiger print). Given the reviews saying that people hardly saw any animals, we were pleasantly surprised by the number that we saw.  The hike lasts until just about 5pm, by which time we were ready to be off our feet. We thought that the experience was worth the 2500 rupees each, as it was fun and informative, despite the mediocre food and the language issues with the guides. So we would recommend it for those who like to hike."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,not much to see,"I was very excited to be visiting this reserve with the hope to see some wildlife. Whilst obviously not expecting to view a tiger, I thought perhaps some elephants, deer and prolific birdlife?? Didn't see much at all, just wandered the forest for a few hours with a guide. He showed us some footprints, a couple of distant birds and 2 spiders. We were supplied with gator like apparatus to protect legs from leeches and the guide regularly doused our feet with a specially concocted powder as we walked to keep them at bay. Often the people at the back of the group couldn't hear what the guide was saying as we walked the trail also. Left a little disappointed"
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Kerala Tourism has to work harder,The sanctuary is accessible by boats for normal tourist not too much into wildlife.Its a nightmare to get a ticket. They do not have enough room for visitors and the ticketing system ensured I had to wait from 7AM to 10AM in the que to get a boat at 11:15 and unfortunately didnt find a single animal in 90 min ride on the boat.
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Kerala family vacation,"About place, it doesn't have much to do. 1. Boat safari is limited 300 person and if you didn't have online booking forget it. 2. Wild safari on jeep only journey are better but nothing at sights 3. Elephant rides etc are not as much thrill as it sound and there is unorganised queue. 4. Couldnot locate a good restaurant at prime location 5. Liquor ban"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Boating in the early morning with family,"we took the first ferry 7:30AM to 9AM. The boating experience was great as the scenery is fantastic. However, animal spotting is rare. we could see a wild pig and some wild buffaloes. Lots of birds though. Overall the experience is recommended."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Calm and Quiet Place,"Beautiful place to visit.. If you are a nature lover, this is the place. Though did not see any tiger ( only one wild bore and some black monkeys), but its a very quiet place."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,A mad rush for boat tickets,Perhaps the most overhyped boating experience in India. Although I had bought online boating tickets for a 7.30 AM trip I had to reach the forest reserve entry gate at 6 AM to buy entry tickets in to Periyar tiger reserve. I was witness to a mad rush of vehicles (specially local three wheelers) trying to get in to the reserve first. The ticket counters were being manned by sleepy individuals who were edgy and irritable. The boating expedition is average with absolutely no hint of wild life . I was told that some wild life is seen in the summer. All in all a pretty average outing.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wildlife sanctuary,This is also falling under same Periyar / Thekkedy areas and having big lake with sanctury. It has rare possibllity to view animals.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful Jeep Safari,"We took a jeep safari thinking it will go inside the forest and we will see animals, but we came to know after visting that it takes on the outskirits of periyaar wildlife sanctuary and no animals we saw, but it was not a disappointment at all, as the experience was awesome, open air jeep, beautiful lush green open spaces, so much of fresh air, we got up at 4am to go for this early morning jeep safari and it was worth it, one of the most beautiful mornings spent outside , i m glad we did as one of the best experience to cherish for a long atime"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Noisy boat ride in rain,"Of all the sanctuaries and parks we visited in Kerala this was the most disappointing. We shared a boat with a noisy local group which would have frightened off most wildlife, and it was raining throughout the journey. Wildlife spotted consisted of a couple of distant red specks that were mongoose and a medium sized water monitor. Of course, had we seen something spectacular like a tiger I'd be raving about the trip. Steep price for what you get with double whammy of entrance fee and boat fee. And a lot of paper work too."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Disappointing,"From the Itinerary, Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary was supposedly meant to have tigers lapping at the waters edge and herds of elephants to see. You actually go on a boat with 80 other people and have to wear a very uncomfortable life jacket which is compulsory, understandably, after a bad accident a few years ago. You are not allowed to stand up or walk around the boat so it is rather restricting. We only saw two bison, a deer and one elephant all in the distance which I feel may have been tethered and slightly set up for the experience. Although they advertise Tigers, there aren't any at all, so you will be disappointed and the write up for the trip has been exaggerated."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar Wildlife Santuary,One has to go during the season. Else all that you see is elephants and the lake. The cruise by the boat is interesting....
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not much wildlife I could spot,"Yes spotting wildlife is luck and I don't want to be standing near to a wild elephant and taking a selfie :)... But having been here for more than 10 times, I have not been lucky to spot much of the wild animals. Jungle ambience, huge trees gives you a greta forest feel"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Really interesting but come prepared!,"We went on a guided walk, which started on a bamboo raft. The guide was OK but we felt he eventually lost interest in us. You need walking boots as underfoot a lot of it was extremely muddy. We were advised to wear dark clothing as I think the leeches are attracted to lighter stuff. We really needed the gaiters they gave us but actually you need to wear a couple of layers and keep everything tucked in as a friend had a leech get onto her skin. Having said that, we were glad we went but we only saw a wart hog and lots of birds as I suspect there are loads of people trailing through there all day, every day and the animals keep well clear!"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Definitely worth a visit...but please plan your trip well,"Periyar as the name suggests is one of the largest wild life reserves in the country spanning over 925 sq kms. The wildlife reserve offers a variety of options to the tourists right from boat rides and bamboo rafting in the Periyar river to jeep safaris as well as night trails.  If you are trying to spot a tiger or any major animal this time of the year (i.e. Nov-Feb) from a boat ride or bamboo rafting, you will most likely be disappointed because at this time of the year the animals have plenty of water in the form of waterfalls and lakes within the interiors of the reserve and the climate is quite cool. The best time for sighting is the summer months (mar-may). So please plan your trips accordingly  This time of the year, the forest provides cool climate to stroll around, take in the nature - lots of tall and old trees and water bodies apart from different birds and insects.  The boat rise gives you a snapshot tour of the reserve. The bamboo rafting is a different experience, we couldn't try it for shortage of time - but please do if you have time.  You could also stay in the resrve and go for 1-3 day treks and trails within the jungles."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful wildlife.,Go for safari and jeep rides. It is cheap if you are a group. ( roughly 1500 - 3000 a ride - max 10 ppl ) One of the best maintained forests.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,jeep safari was a different experience altogether!,"the guide and driver was very cordial and ever alert to meet the details of the trip.....a ride through the forest with water gushing against the rocks , huge trees , haze moving around and cool climate.....adventurous ride with eyes running through and through the trees and grasses just to spot another wild animals to longer the list of ""i've seen them"". Truly amazing experience...gives you a feel of how the discovery, national geographic guys live and shoot amongst these huge habitats."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Border safari periyar,Most tourists may make the mistake of equating it to the real safari into the periyar sanctuary. Please note that it has nothing to do with the real stuff. Border Safari periyar sanctuary  Went with a lot of expectations from what turned out to be a wild goose hunt without going into the wild. A jeep pick up which takes you through the unpaved highs and lows of tea plantations and private lands. There are three viewing points. Beautiful sights of the landscape which will fascinate you. If u are lucky then u may spot animals appearing as black spots on the hill top. We saw two deer and ? Bison. You do not enter the Periyar but only view the border of it. Don't waste 2500 on it. It is only for the aerial view of the region and has nothing to do with wildlife.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Overhyped Wild life sanctuary,Boating was good with great views and thru jungles.No animal was visilbe except one or two kingfisher birds.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nature at its prime...,"I went to Periyar with the aim of seeing and photographing butterflies, and I wasn't disappointed. The park is located high up in the Cardamom hills surrounding Periyar Lake and bordering Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It's an area of rich bio-diversity, harbouring many rare fauna and flora. We needed to book a guide quite some time in advance for the nature walk, but it was really worth it. Started with the lake crossing, on a raft made out of lengths of bamboo tied together with a rope attached to each bank so it could be pulled across. Then walked through areas of tropical evergreen and moist deciduous forests, grasslands, stands of eucalyptus, and lake and river ecosystems. The whole area was alive with butterflies, dragon and damselflies, and small creatures of all kinds, many endemic. Came across a small grove where several Malabar Tree nymphs provided a mystical, awe-inspiring atmosphere with their slow fluttering and gliding amongst the trees. A rare site. 265 species of birds, 160 butterflies and 35 species of mammals can be seen in the park if one is lucky, as well as many insects, reptiles and frogs.. The guide was very knowledgeable and guided us to places that catered to our interests. People who once made a living by illegal operations in the forests have since become forest protectors and earn their livelihood guiding these forest walks.It is a great example of successful eco-based tourism. It was raining when we first arrived and we went to a little wired in cafe to drink a great chai. An interesting experience - the humans in the cage, and the monkeys outside trying to get in ! Definitely ask for the guide for a day, to explore the park, especially for nature lovers. It is also possible to camp out in the park overnight with a guide."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,The famous Sanctuary,The most attractive wild life sanctuary in Kerala actually the tourist Place known as Thekkady is also a part of this sanctuary
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Disappointing,We took the early morning boat trip in hopes of seeing wildlife. Fully appreciate the odds are against seeing the big draw animals....but I guess only birds are up then. Seating is not that comfortable but OK. The bench row seating design makes it difficult to see if on the inside. I would not make a special trip for this activity but if in the vacinity you may have better luck than I in seeing wildlife. Do take binoculars just to be safe.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful Forest.!! Clean and neat. !!,"Periyar wild life and thekkady is such an awesome place for a 2 or 3 day stay. Beautiful forest, mountains and hills, grass lands, wild animals etc etc. Boating in periyar lake is an unforgettable one. saw elephants and many wild animals. it's the only place for spices. I suggest for a jeep safari to sathram. it's one of the beautiful place I ever seen. thekkady is soo amazing.."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Peaceful,"Nice peaceful place. Jungles - treat to eyes.We were lucky to have spotted an herd of bison, a deer and a big lizard.Disgusting that Some of the visitors did not refrain from smoking on the way to boat boarding point. PTR is suggested to put 'No Smoking' boards more prominently and more frequently and should ask the visitors to deposit their cigarettes and match boxes at the barrier itself."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Very disappointing,"When we arranged this we had visions of taking a quiet trip around the lake in a smallish boat, and perhaps being lucky enough to see the odd elephant or two, but this turned out to be a pipe dream. The boat we were put on held about 250 passengers, most of whom did not understand the concept of keeping quiet, which dashed any hopes of seeing much in the way of wildlife. We were lucky enough to secure seats next to the railing, but the view of most of the people sitting in the middle of the boat must have been very limited. We saw a few birds (kingfishers, cormorants, and a Brahminy Kite) and also some bison and antelopes, both in the far distance, but that were all."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wonderful and adventurous nature walk,"We decided to visit the national park not by boat but by foot. Different to most of the European national parks, it is not possible to visit it on your own. So we took a guide and enjoyed the 2,5-hours nature walk. The guide acknowledged our physical constitution and did a pretty fast walk through the forest. Since we visited the park at the end of the monsun season, we did not see many animals but still some elephant footprints, monkeys, birds and last but not least a bison herd. It was a great experience. We had an excellent guide and a wonderful walk in the beautiful Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary. Walking clothes and walking boots are crucial. Fortunately, they offer complementary leech socks."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Must visit,thekkady has actual countryside and wildlife to show to its travelers. this sanctuary is nice and weather in January was favorable.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,First walk on the wild side,"The first impression at the car park was not good with hundreds of people walking along the road but once we reached the Park only our group of fifteen were booked for the forest tour. We were fitted with leech socks and I would also recommend walking shoes, there had been a great deal of rain and trainers were only just adequate, because of the rain we had to raft across the river, a great way to start the adventure. We were split into groups of four and a knowledgeable guide pointed out different birds, vegetation and animals. We didn't expect to see a tiger but would have liked to see elephants. He took some great photos using our cameras and we were walking for a couple of hours."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Too wet for elephants but plenty of leeches!,"Don't let that put you off!! But I will return in the dry season.The sanctuary is wonderful with guided walks and a real insight into jungle. Just when you think you are one a lovely walk in the home counties a scorpion crosses your path and you remember that everything in the forest is maybe not so innocent. A real adventure but carefully managed. Take walking clothes, walking boots and do remember to obtain leech socks."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,"""Boating experience is fantasic""",Recently we are going to periyar Wildlife santuary the boat ride and the location is awesome but the getting boat ticket is more risk at the same time compare to others boat ride this one is good one.The lake view also very panoramic view we really like that place.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice forest,"Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary gives you various options for things to do. Many tourists that i have come across think only about the lake cruise but in actuality it offers night trekking, couple level of difficulties of day trekking, bamboo rafting, jeep safari, etc. It is advisable to travel in a small group as some of the activities need a minimum booking of certain number of people and check the days of your visit as all activities are not available daily. I went for the Jeep Safari near the Gavi village and happened to see Elephants from a distance, monkeys and a few birds. However the jeeps now only follow the marked out path through the sanctuary and no longer go deep into the forest due to the tragic death of a couple of irresponsible tourists at the hands of a few wild elephants. This safari is followed by breakfast and a small trek before a boatman rows you across the lake to a nice small waterfall for you to enjoy its fresh cold water. This is followed by a typical kerela style lunch and a visit to a cardamom plantation and animal bone museum (nothing special). You may also opt to stay the night in one of their tents. Night trekking near the Thekkady entrance to the Periyar Sanctuary is another activity i participated in, where you enter the sanctuary with a couple of forest rangers who have guns for your protection and you ofcourse only armed with a torch make your way through the forest trying your luck to spot as many animals as you can. I saw a herd of spotted and barking deer and an obstinacy of bison which unfortunately cut our trek short as it was unsafe to go any further as these dangerous bisons had cut our path of. Also please beware of leaches."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Must visit place,"Dense forest reserves and well maintained. Tourist can plan lot of forest activities which include river rappling, day and nigh trekking programs.  Taking pictures of different species in the wild jungle. Animals like dear, elephant , birds etc..."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Missed occasion,"Beautiful place very badly managed, see my review for Periyar lake. It could be a good experience, but you just get upset especially after paying a ticket which is not so cheap plus extras for camera and video"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice experience,"We got the upper deck ticket as it has very clear views of jungle and lake, we were not lucky to see the tiger but saw many other animals. it was very adventures and memorable trip for me."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Pleasant Boat ride,"I am sivakumar from Chennai. I have visited thekkady with my wife in Oct'15. We have booked boat ride online by paying 500 Rs. per head through Mr. Justin, owner of periyar woods home stay on 24 Oct'15 at 9.30 a.m. We reached their at last neck of the moment & collected the tickets & entered in to the boat. It takes 1 hour to reach the boat from our home stay periyar woods. We got the tickets for double decker boat on the top floor. Boat ride we very pleasant & we saw elephants, Deer, Boar & Gaur. One must have boat ride in Thekkady"
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Dissapointing Experience,We took a jeep safari to the sanctuary but it was dissapointing. No animals were visible. Safari path stuck to the plantation area and showed us view points at high levels but no visibility of any animal whatsoever.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful lake and surrounding areas,"Visited here recently, lovely national park area and lake. We had a 1 1/2 her cruise, which was about the right duration. Had hoped to see elephants but didn't. Apparently elephant sightings are rare. Very crowded at the ticket office, big ques so online booking in advance essential, our guide booked tickets for us. There are several cruises each day (I think it's about 5) we went on the 1st cruise which left about 7.30 am. We saw wild boar, a bison, monitor lizard, and loads of birds. Beautiful scenery snd helpful staff on the boat."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not well Managed,The only major attraction is boat ride in the river whch runs through the jungle where you will not see any animal. But for boat ride you need ticket...and you stand in line for a family and then told only two tickets per person. You ask for 1:30 PM boat and the reply you get is it is full you may get 3:00 PM boat if online reservation people dont come. All this after 2 to 3 hrs of waiting... So plan it well and be aware of Monkeys. Onine is expensive but worth it...choice is yours.. waiting to see nothing or convenience atleast.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Lake cum sanctuary,There are different names but the lake and reseve is one and the same. One needs to be lucky to spot animals.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Cool Boat Ride - but Expensive !,"The ~75min Boat ride down Periyar Lake into Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary is Serene, Cool - and Uneventful. At Rs.75 Car Ticket + Rs.75 Entry Ticket/ person + Rs.225 Boat Ride Ticket/ person, it is a Stiff Tariff by any measure. The Lake winds through the Wild Life Sanctuary but there are No Signs of Life - not even a stray bird. Fresh Air, an Eyeful of Greenery & Calm Silence for ~75 mins Sums up the Total Experience. Staff are mostly indifferent."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good,Very nice view but we didn't see except few animals like some kinds of birds and elephants. For us this is not enough since we saw lot of elephants in streets and shows.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,worth a boat ride,there is only boat riding at this place and no more speciality but the area is greener and with good security .  after getting down from car or vehicle one need to walk 1km to reach the boating place.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Sure shot try for Bamboo Rafting and Trekking,Nice place for chilling out with friends and family. Should definitely try out the bamboo rafting and trekking packages with friends. it will be a nice experience
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Cool Breeze to skin and Greenery to eyes.. Periyar Boating,"For people who prefer greenery a must visit place.Visited here last week with my friends and did a morning boating at 7.30 am. First and foremost is to praise the security and safety measures undertaken inside the boat. Restricted movements inside the boat ( Walking, Dancing etc). Life jackets are provided to each and every tourists. Each boat carries tourists only upto seating capacity. Why i am revealing this is because there occured a boat tragedy(Jalakanyaka) on 2009 september 30 which took away life of 45 people.Just two days before this incident i had boating there. Security issues were prominent.as i remember.Visiting the same place after six years reminded this. but i was totally happy about present situation. The boat cruise is for one and half hours. Full of greenery all around. If you are so lucky you can spot animals as i was a little bit unlucky spotted some deers only.But the Life Guard in boat conveyed as they spotted a tiger and elephant the previous day evening 4.30 pm cruise. Totally Worthy and calm for a lush green ride. Check Photos. For a morning boating the Tiger Reserve opens at 6.30 am and Individual and vehicle fare has to be taken at the gate. Then after parking you have to walk about 600 metres to reach the boating spot where there you have to take boating tickets.Please check for prices as i am not remembering as i was in a hurry being late Overall enjoyed and recommending all."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Must visit,Beautiful raw place. definitely try the boat ride its a wonderful way to experience wildlife. we took the 7 am boat ride for 2hr duration and it was sufficient.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Greeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnn,"Its good place to visit and see lots of greenery. We get peaceful inside with flora, ride on the elephants was good. A good place to visit during monsoon."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Lots of greenery connects to nature,"Its good place to visit in Thekkady and see lots of greenery .Its lot peaceful inside with flora . It was good ride on the elephants , however other species i didnt manage to see .A good place to visit during monsoon."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,wow place for all,"cool place to visit n very imp too so amust watch if u r in thekkady. i have booked my ticket online so no zhanzhat of line n all.trip was adventurous,romantic thrilling n sopeacefulu donno when td time pass by.view was awesome. my kid enjoyed a lot .i took the last boat which was around 3 30 slot n was very enjoyable to have at dat time of hour .the prompt staff helped me in taking the cool pics of deers bison turtles n lovely birds around.i liked my ride so much."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Natural feelings,"Surrounded by unending chains of hills and forest , boating to view the wildlife reserves conjures up images of elephants small and big along with rare birds and endangering animals are natural feelings."
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Scam,This is just a money making gimmick..there is nothing to see here except for some elephants which are any way so far off.. Trust me not worth it all..
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Expensive just to see a monitor lizard, a domestic cat, livestock and some otters ...","You pay to get into park and a small fee for the driver, pay for the boat trip and pay even more to take a camera all to view animals we could otherwise see when driving around the town.  Obviously I know you can't make animals appear but I feel there isn't much scope to see animals from the vantage the boat tour provides. I would suggest one of the other activities available at the park.  However, saying that, the boat ride was enjoyable and the staff were quick to point out the few wildlife we did see, well, apart from the cat, that was me."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Average,We got up early to get the tickets. There was a big queue for tickets. There was a bot ride of ~90 mins. We didn't see any animals. The way to ticket counter from the main gate was better than overall boat ride. You are not going to miss anything even if you don't visit this place.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nothing special except nature.,"I am visiting this sanctuary since long. Never seen Tiger there. They have boating facility inside lake, but it is insufficient."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,"""Great Boating Experience in Wildlife""",This is the only sanctuary in India where you can have the unique experience of viewing the wild life at close quarters from the safety of a Boat. The sanctuary is built around Periyar lake.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Cruise through the Sanctuary,"Ok.. so you get to see the sanctuary from the safe environs of a boat. I am pretty sure there are not too many places where you can do so. But unless any of the animals decide to sun themselves by the waterfront.... you will not have any sightings. To be fair, we did spot antelopes and a pack of wild dogs. But would prefer to toil through the wilderness any day.... rather than watch it from afar. That said, the environs are pristine and the lazy boat ride has a strange meditative quality."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Green and Serene nature at all its best,"The wilderness and green evergreen forests of Thekkady has always been a fascination for me and I look forward for my next visit once I leave from there every time. This is the ideal location for nature lovers who would like to spend their vacation peacefully and laid down on natures lap. I have visited Thekkady during all seasons and every season has its own advantages and offerings. If you are looking for elephant sightings, then yo need to visit Thekkady during the summer (March- May). But you can always find herds of bisons, sambhar deers, wild boars, Asiam Monkeys, Asiatic Lion Tiled monkeys, wild squirrels, wild hen and lots of wild birds all the year round.  For adventure enthusiasts, there are lots of options like trekking through the dense forests, rafting on the lakes on a bamboo raft, elephant safari and plantation tours. Thekkady is an unique location which will provide you something new on every visit and you will lots of memories to cherish until you return back the next time.  There are lots of Govt owned properties (Lake Place,Aranya Nivas, Periyar House) and many well maintained private properties in and around Thekkady which provides very good accommodation facilities for you and your family.  Things to do: 1. A boating on the Mullaiperiyar Lake where you can see the beauty of the wild evergreen forest so close and also see wild animals like bisons,deers,boars and if you are lucky wild elephants and a variety of monkeys from a very close distance.  2. Trekking on the forest (You will be escorted by trained guides from Wild Life department) Ensure you get the service from the Govt Wild Life department itself.  3. River rafting on a bamboo raft (Ensure you contact the wild life office at boat landing for the service)  4. Elephant ride and Jeep Safaris (You can find lots a of private groups providing this service in Thekkady and its very easy to find around. Do bargain for better packages)  5. Go for a plantation tour (There are lots of Spice plantations and Tea plantattions around Thekkady which is worth a visit) Do bargain for better packages as its mostly operated by private service providers."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,wild life..keep it for our next generation..,nice to see...wild life in front of our eyes...we can understand the living habit of different types of animals and birds..really amazing...we should not disturb them..because without them this earth is zero...
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good Sanctuary,"Those who are living near this lake i mean in city is best for morning joggers,fresh morning,we visited during winter time which is very cool,must wear winter jackets,food is there,baby bugging park is not there,picnic is the best post,boat ride is there which is to view the exotic birds,we can take beautiful photos which is best attraction here because of this beautiful greenery nature 'o' lake."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Must Visit,"Great to visit in morning early. A slow boat ride through the beautiful lake. Did spot bisons , elephants no tigers though."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A truly authentic wildlife experience,Paid 2000 rs. to go for a full day trek. Only 4 in our group with 2 guides and a guard. Amazing landscape and wildlife and the guides are very informative. Walked for a few hours then we had to help row a bamboo raft across the huge lake. Then we did a walking loop and saw deer and then has the exhilarating experience of spotting and quietly staking an elephant. A shame we had to come back the same way we came and the included lunch consisted of lots of dry pastry type items. Otherwise a brilliant adventure.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,SEE THE ANIMALS,"main attraction - boating boating fee - Rs.225  you can see animals like elephants,tigers,dears,wolves... many food&accomodation facilities are available. elephant riding are provided by private parties."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice place,"Must visit place. One should visit early morning. The view is good. One of the biggest lakes I have ever seen. The jungle is nice, birds are many"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,nice,Such a pretty place. We had a nice boat ride and spotted few creatures too. Overall we enjoyed the trip.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Tiger Spotting,"Went there on a rainy, misty morning to see the wildlife. We did see some deer and wild pigs and such but no tigers. A nice boat ride for about 90 minutes. Park is lovely."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Very clean wildlife sanctuary,"Very clean wildlife sanctuary, well maintained and very rarefull we can see deers, tortoise etc. Boats are nice"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A nice place to feel the beauty of nature,We can see the beauty of nature here. One lake where the animals come for drinking water. One must visit the place early morning to have a glimpse of wild animals. The park opens for public at 5 but ticket for boat can be bought at 6 am. Difficult with young children to stand in queue.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,paradise view in morning of lake and fog,"only way to visit sanctuary is to have the boat ride, we took the early morning boat ride the boat slowly goes in the lake deep in the sanctuary about 5 kms , on both side of lake is the jungle, we visited in winter , the climate was cold, but the water downside , a bit of fog and the background the hilly green area, fresh atmosphere pollutionless, feeled like a look of heaven as shown in films, a great expereince"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Serene Laid Back Experience,"It is a nice and Serene place for a visit. Though it says a tiger reserve, the odd's of spotting a tiger during the boat ride is once a year. I was obviously not lucky enough to spot a tiger. Did get a chance to see other animals though. If you like a laid back experience with no expectation's, you will like this place. If not, you can get easily boared. Also for hindi movie buffs, this was also incidentally one of the places where ""jiya Jale"" song from ""Dil se"" movie was shot. So, all in all, personally i enjoyed it."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Boat trip,"Visited Periyar Sanctuary, there were no walks available so took the boat trip. Boat slowly travels for about 5km up river then heads back. Lots of bird life on the water, and saw some deer and mountain goats from afar, but otherwise a non eventful trip, and the boat gets quite noisy with tourists. Pleasant, but wouldn't go out of my way to do this one."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Average - you cant explore the Sanctuary on your own,"It was OK. Visit only during on season. Nothing to watch during summers here. On boat, take the window seat else boat ride not worth."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Stunning Views,Views are excellent . Didn't see much animals We had lovely snacks and coffee. Very serene truly Gods Country
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful nature in beautiful surrounding,"I took a 2 hour boat trip at 7 o'clock in the morning when the sun was rising and it was all calm and peaceful. The quiet water was now and then disturbed by beautiful birds like the Kingfisher with its amazing blue wings. Groups of elephants were strolling over the hills, monkeys were playing on the banks and gaurs (aka the Indian bison) were grazing. It was in october, so I don't know if that was a good time to visit, but there was enough to see in this beautiful surrounding. Don't expect to see spectacular wildlife, just enjoy the peaceful nature."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Real Forest area,"Periyar Tiger Reserve,Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary are same palces. best is to book advance tickets for a boat ride"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Few animals plenty of birds,July is not the best time to see animals. Fortunate to see some elephants and deer. Summer is the best time. However we could see a lot of birds
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not that many animals,"It's a nice trip, but beside the monkeys, that you can see by millions, not a lot to see. We where lucky and catch about 15 elephants very close but many people didn't.  The tigers,... well,... if you're incredibly lucky..."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Serene Quiet & Green,"A simple walk around the sanctuary gives you an idea of how densely populated it is with green trees and flora. The boat ride is good but if you are a photographer, do carry your extra zoom lens camera as they don't go close to the animals. The sanctuary overall is well maintained and I would have loved to stay in one of their jungle camps."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,periyaar wildlife,"Hey its an artificial lake made for tourist attraction where a boat kind of takes you to see animals like elephant ,monkeys and deers.No tiger is seen in this boat ride as this jungle is very huge and tigers ofcourse are deep inside the jungle and they dont come out.There is an entry fee to enter the place and also Rs 350 pp for boat ride"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful,"Next to Thekkady a beautiful wildlife sanctuary. Beautiful forest, well maintained & good facilities for tourist. Had been there during winter & the forest was very pleasant & temperature/climate was great."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary - Best Landmark in Thekkady,God's own country - says it all...this wildlife sanctuary takes the cake amongst all places in and around Thekkady! The leisurely boat ride around the sanctuary on the water body is simply breath-taking simply for the bountiful nature that it throws all around!
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Have the morning walk!,"We went there for a 2,5 hour morning walk. The rikshaw always charges 80 rupies from Kumily center to the boat landing, do don't let them fool you if they stop at the official park entrance and ticket office and don't want to carry on after (there's another 3 km to go). Vinod, our guide and one of the local tribes, was extremely entertaining, friendly and helpful, and he showed us many many interesting things we would have missed without him. The tour takes some 2,5 hours, costs normally 300 rupies each, but they don't leave until at least 1200 rupies are collected, so we ended up paying 600 each (plus another 450 each entrance fee), but it was totally worth it! Many leeches, but you get leech socks :). Just don't take the boat, it looks horrible from the distance, with all these noisy people on board.."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A must river cruise or elephant ride.,"Its wonderful to cruise through the river Periyar. If you are lucky, you may spot wild elephants, tigers, and deer."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,So So,"Maybe we didn't see the entire thing, it seemed very complicated, we thought by payiing at the gate that we were paying to get in..apparently not, more confusion, we finally took a walk and left. Lots of monkies and people."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Elephants!!,"So many elephants we could see during boating..remember to do online ticket for boat trip! Our tickets were booked from the resort itslef, Springdale Heritage."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Sheer waste of time,Theres nothing interesting here apart from the boat ride you get. You will see nothing of any kind of wildlife. please avoid visting this place. there are better places to go
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Waste of time,"Do not have any wildlife except for birds, buffalos and deer. Boat ride is very slow and with filthy life jackets across the small lake. Definitely not a good activity for youngsters. The lake is good but as they claim, I couldn't see any interesting birds or animals. there were usual birds, buffalos and deer. The boat has lot of people, so if you're on the inside you won't see anything at all. Basically, the 30-45 minutes boat ride rest is entire waste of time. Rather the area outside is better to eat, click pictures and do time pass."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Complete waste of time,The only thing worth doing is the 30-45 minutes boat ride rest is entire waste of time. Wasn't able to see any Wide life creatures up close during the boat ride though
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,very exciting journey,"me and my husband just completed our journey to thekkady.. we were staying at KTDC periyar house for past 2 days. while on boat journey saw sambar deer, gaur and eagles. stay was nice . periyar house stands inside the tiger reserve, so we can feel the atmosphere quite well.. on the next day we did a half day bamboo rafting programme. we started at 7.30 in the morning with forest guard.. we got the opportunity to walk through the jungle for around 10 kms.. could see giant squirrel, indian bison, malabar hornbill and even great indian hornbill. later on bamboo rafting , we could see a group of 7 elephants. it was very exciting. since it was begining of off season, we were the only ones on that day to do the tour.. we really enjoyed it. those who wants to enjoy a couple of days of excitement and joy this is ideal( children below 12 are not allowed for trucking programmes)"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Scam,"I went to Periyar in Jan 2015, I want to spend at least 2 days in the sanctuary but there is no accommodation in Sanctuary or camp site. I was looking for an Elephant and Birds, I been doing Wild life since from 5 years now.  According to local i came to know that some local have arrange Sanctuary tour, so i went and sign for that paid 5 k for 2 person and they have given old jeep, I was pretty impressed, they told me whole scheduled, that at 4 am they will come and pick me from hotel and take me to sanctuary which was close by, it was pretty well arranged. I have Specifically asked them that i have only interest in wild life not boating trekking or anything stupid kiddish activity on chart, on that i have singed for this expedition.I will only do Bird watching in Forest whole on that basis i have signed for this expedition.Thought local have more knowledge of the Sanctuary more than me.  So as the driver pick me a 5 am early morning we reached at 7 am at periyar sanctuary. There was big Que of car full with kids and family waiting to sanctuary to open up. which looked chaotic so i was very clear not single animal i can get to see today.  As the journey begin, with all this not welled experience drivers started to go into sanctuary, they were so load like they came to some function have. We stopped to look at the ""nilgiri Monkeys"" and met with an accident 4 jeep crashed on each others. Now this drivers think they are aware all wild life,soon came to know very poor experienced driver and so call "" GUIDE""!  After 9 km we stopped for breakfast they have arranged, it was lame food as Kerala is famous for that, We done with that and asked driver lets go further into sanctuary because in my GPS still 60% sanctuary left to explore i want to get moving before all this noisy family start catching up like exploring zoo, So i asked driver "" lets go man""! he replied with ""where to, this is end of the tour, from here you guys do trekking or boating? i was shocked, told him to lead me into depth of jungle, his reply was so shocking that "" we need to hire other guide and that will cost 3k per person to go further into Sanctuary"" which is like 8 km more, i was so surprised that these people are ripping all this tourist on the name of Wild life tour, and taking 3k per person. After long argument with management and driver i have decided to come back and lead my next destination. No point to waste another 6k with these scammer.  It was the worst experience, got ripped of, if you wish to travel just to explore jungle, greenery, mountains its okay. but do not waste 6k at Thekkady,so scammer organization who arranged this expedition, go to pug mark and explore with them."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,"We loved the countryside in India, the roads are windy but it's all worth it!!","The wild country of India is amazing. Beautiful landscapes of expansive green forests and all of the creatures that live there. You can catch a glimpse of mountain sheep, deer, goats, soaring birds and other interesting things."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,great place,"tracking elephant day and night on foot was the most brilliant experience ever , hiding behind a tree 15 foot from wild elephants is a massive adrenalin buzz , lots of other wildlife mongoose samba deer wild boar and muck more . also a beautiful place"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Leeched Out,"The Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary in Thekkady is around 150 kms from the Kochi Airport and 135 kms from the Madurai Railway station. There are plenty of places to stay out the gates of the Sanctuary as well as within. Both have their pros and cons. On the inside you may chance upon a herd of sambar deer or wild bores but the gates of the sanctuary close after 6pm and visiting the market outside will not be possible. We were a group of 4 that visited here in the month of May 2015 and went ahead with a few activities. Bamboo Rafting- This is an all day program that starts at 8 am and ends by 5 pm. The program starts off with an hours trek through the forest to reach the Periyar lake and the bamboo rafts. We then set out across the lake to a patrol outpost to have our mini packed breakfasts (Breakfast and lunch is provided at the start of the trek in small boxes. This isn't sufficient to sustain you through the day, so please carry your own energy bars/drinks). After a couple of hours of rowing to different parts of the lake, you trek your way back through the forest. The guard and guides along with you are very helpful and do explain everything to you about your surroundings.  We were not able to see many animals around but did chance upon a herd of Indian Gaur and a Red necked mongoose, who just loved the camera.  Tips: - If you are planning on this trip during the summers, Sun screen is a must and do carry clothing to cover yourself while on the bamboo boat. If you do make your way here during the monsoons or a rain...WATCH OUT FOR THE LEECHES!!"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Ride to the Woods,This is good for 1st time travellers and you need to be extremely luck to spot any animals. But it has quite improved its service and no more long ques for booking tickets as tickets are sold online which is really good and boats are also improvised
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great place to visit,Come early in the day to avoid crowds. Also avoid weekends and public holidays as there are people from within and outer states.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Very popular with visitors,"Periyar is very popular with lots of buses,cars, and people everywhere along the road to the lake. Having said that we did manage to see deer, wild pigs, a giant squirrel as well as lots of both brown and black monkeys."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,food is too good,"food is made in coconut oil and its taste is delicious like vada with coconut chutney, masala dosa, set dosa, idli with sambar, etc i don't know about lunch or dinner."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Enjoyed the walk and rafting but almost no animal sightings,"We signed up for the full day river rafting and trekking at the Periyar Tiger Reserve. Assembled at the rangers' hut within the reserve at 8am and a briefing was given, leech proof socks dished out, packed breakfast and lunch given. Advisable to bring knapsack as otherwise, you will be carrying these paper bags the whole day.  We are told that they allow about 10-12 people everyday on this trip and there were no less than 6 guides with us and one other ranger with a rifle.  The rafting and walking was enjoyable but it was scorching hot with very little tree cover most parts of the trip. The only animals we saw were some monkeys, wild boar (at a distance), a squirrel and a hornbill....and most of these, plus deers can be seen near the park entrance! Well, of course we were pointed out to what was (we were told) tiger footprints.  Enjoyed the walk and rafting but can't help feeling a bit disappointed so far as wildlife sightings go."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not so wild but lush,I would classify this sanctuary more for its lushness and greenery than the wildlife. The only interesting option available for a short visit is the boat ride around the Periyar Lake. Whatever animals you can spot is your good luck. The real value of this sanctuary is perhaps in the treks and camping in the wild which I did not undertake. The lake boat ride was well organized and ideal to take the first ride in the morning at 7:30 AM to increase chance of animal sightings. Good for a single visit.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Lovely morning walk,WE did a guided morning walk during our visit. Organised prior to arrival. Limited wildlife but several birds I did not know and lots of trees and plants were of interest. Less animals and more habitat but a lovely relaxing walk away from the lake area and the tourist boats that we tried and did avoid. Worth a visit.
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nothing much,"Do not have any wildlife except for birds, buffalos and deer. Boat trip is expensive with a very slow ride across the small lake. Not a good activity for youngsters."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Excellent guide and varied views on walking tour,"Our guide was knowledgeable, with reasonable English, interesting, patient and observant which contributed to one of the best experiences of our Keralan tour.  OK - maybe we were lucky. We had an older, experienced guide who'd worked on the reserve for over 20 years, and we were the first ones to leave the lodge to start the trek. So we benefited from seeing a range of flora and fauna in different corners of the park, which we would not have done from a simple boat ride. And we were out and away without being bothered by the car park monkeys.  After the initial, slightly worrying river-crossing, standing on the bamboo raft, from which we could see egrets and other birds fishing, we set off across the edge of the wooded area. Early on, we were lucky enough to see a mongoose. As we got further in, our guide spotted a herd of gaurs in a clearing (and he was generous enough to let other groups know and join us).  We set off and again were the first to spot a mother elephant and her very young calf, so we watched and waited (mother elephants can be dangerously protective) as they grazed and moved slowly away.  Before moving off into the higher ground, where we saw wild chickens and monkeys and some incredible trees, we encountered the local fishermen, returning with sacks of fish balanced on their heads.  Unfortunately we were only advised by our driver not to wear red and were not told to avoid wearing white - so as it got warmer, my husband had to keep his black fleece on over his white t-shirt. But otherwise - a great morning. and we were back in time for breakfast."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Watch Out For The Leeches,"We took a morning hike and bamboo raft ride in the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary. It was a nice walk with many birds, a few animals and informative guides; however, it is rare to see Tigers or elephants. But there were lots of leeches especially where we put on shoe covers to protect us from those leeches."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great Eample of Natural Bounty,"The lovley wild life sanctuary is notable as an elephant reserve and a tiger reserve. It lies in the middle of a mountainous area of the Cardamom Hills. With great scenic charm, rich bio diversity and providing veritable visitor satisfaction. It is a community based Eco-Tourism project. Boating through periyar is an exiting experiance"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Monkeys,"The park itself is lovely but the monkeys were quite terrifying and no one is there to stop them harrassing tourists, we armed ourselves with sticks on the return walk back to our transport. Very dissapointed that we did not see tigers or any elephants on the boat tour."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A more interesting boat trip than I expected,"Our Kerala tour included the boat trip at Periyar as part of the package and it was better than I expected, having read reviews that the wildlife viewing can be disappointing. There were plenty of birds as well as otters, deer, wild boar and water buffalo. Needless to say we did not see a tiger but, briefly, 3 elephants were visible through the trees. I was fortunate to have a seat next to the railings of the boat on the upper deck and so had the opportunity to take some good pictures with a telephoto lens. If you do not have binoculars or cameras with telephoto lenses I think the trip would be disappointing."
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,No chance to see animals on this noisy boat!,"It may have been because Easter was coming up, but the 2-deck boat we travelled on was full of noisy Indian tourists.It was hot and uncomfortable and we didn't go anywhere near the banks of the lake, so that only those with binoculars or good cameras got to see anything in detail. We did see deer and elephants at a distance. Don't waste your money."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A long walk....,"We took an all day hike and bamboo raft ride thru Periyar Tiger Reserve. It was a lovely walk with many birds, a few animals and informative guides, but I get the feeling that it's rare to see Tigers or elephants as they tend to be out at dawn or dusk and the hike is mid-day. Al in all, a fun day, but no big sightings...."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Good, but too conservative.","Periyar wildlife sanctuary can be experienced in different ways.  Boat cruise: Go to the boating station next to the KTDC resort. You need an entry pass for the vehicle and the passengers. The afternoon boat is probably the best bet to see some animals approach the waterfront. But do not expect to see a lot of wild life apart from deers, gaurs and (if you are lucky) wild elephants. It can get heavily crowded in peak season so book early (online advance booking is possible). The cruise lasts 1.5 hours and you need an hour early (even if you have a booking). There is a canteen which doesn't offer much and it is constantly under threat from monkeys, so feed yourself well before going there.  Bus safari: There is a bus safari that starts from a village about 20 kms from Kumily town and takes you through a jungle route to Gavi. Again, there isn't much of a chance that you will spot much wildlife. The best bet might be the morning safari in this case.  Bamboo rafting, Jungle safari with trekking: When we visited, the jungle safari was closed (reason being some foreigners were attacked by elephants the previous week). The bamboo rafting was open, but they didn't let us take it as we had children (aged 6 and 11). They did not relent even when we told them our kids were perfectly capable of handling the trek. There are people who will try to sell you a 2.5 hour tour including plantation tours, etc. which is not really worth it to be honest.  There are some jungle camps as well but very highly priced. Frankly, Periyar turned out to be a disappointing experience for us - not very accessible and not really offering any opportunities to experience the jungle or the wildlife."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Take a Jungle Walk,"I have already reviewed our afternoon cruise on Lake Periyar under that heading; so this refers to a self-guided stroll that we took prior to the cruise. From the Park's field centre there is an excellent short trail that leads right through the forest and down to the lake. For some reason this is not well publicised which is a pity because for the foreigner it gives an excellent insight into the flora and fauna of the area with explanatory panels at regular intervals. If I could have a wish it would be to extend this walk - publicised as an hour but it actually takes about half that - or even create a network of such walks - obviously this is limited to the most popular area anyway or else it would disturb the wildlife. As it was we watched breathlessly as a family of Sambar Deer passed us, quite closely!"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good one but could be better managed,"This sanctuary has the feeling of a forest, but feels this is at its best after the monsoon and in the rains. One can see a lo type of monkeys, elephants, deer, wild ox, infinite variety of birds, and if you go deep into forest may be you will see the real wild animals like tiger & cheetah ."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Get connected with an Elephant,"At Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary you can connect with elephants. You ride the elephant, wash it and feed it. On top of that you may get an elephant shower."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Blissful visit,"Thanks to Tripadvisor and the reviews provided here. Based on this we had booked the first trip. We also booked Aranya Nivas, the hotel that is inside the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary which overlooks this beautiful Lake. The advantage being that you dont need to get in the queue to get the tickets for the boat ride in the sanctuary. While checking in the front office gives various trips and options. Got the tickets for the first ride for boating !!! We saw deers, wild boars, many birds and elephants. Overall its was a very memorable experience"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,To appreciate the Park and all it has to offer it is essential to walk.,"Most visitors just come for the boat ride on the Lake and although that is fun it is not a good Periyar experience. The boats are often overcrowded and rowdy and you will only see wildlife from a distance. To get up close to wildlife it is essential to walk and you can do no better than do was we did and opt for the three day \ two nights Tiger Trek, though we were under no illusions that we would see a Tiger. There are about 45 in the park, 40 or so of which have been caught on camera traps recently, but the chance of a sighting is very rare indeed.  A maximum of six people are allowed to take part in the trek at any one time and my wife and I were accompanied by a German couple, their daughter and the daughter's Indian boyfriend. The guides, three of them, were all ex poachers and extremely experienced in jungle life and we were accompanied by a ranger complete with ancient rifle, just in case. A very close encounter with a young elephant persuaded the ranger to take off the safety catch but luckily the elephant ran back to its mother rather than charging at us so the danger quickly passed. We learnt a lot and saw many of the birds and animals expected, including many elephants and their young.  Tented accommodation was adequate though, with a thin covering on a concrete base, a little hard. Sleeping bags are provided though I would recommend you take a thin liner to sleep in. However there are no washing or toilet facilities and as for the latter you have to go into the bush; therefore it is something you don't do at night. Both nights elephants decided to visit and from their droppings we could see that they got very close indeed. In case you are worried tents are protected by a deep moat which the elephants cannot cross!  Cooking was undertaken on a couple of wood stoves and how they managed to serve up such tasty vegetarian food is a mystery. We were able to buy some fish from a passing tribal fisherman that was served both curried and fried.  We had also booked a full day's trek, following the three day one, but as we would have covered similar ground and we were rather tired from walking far in the heat decided to give that a miss. However if you are not up to the privations of two nights in a tent then I am sure the day trek is an excellent alternative.  We did go out the following day for a morning walk with Raj Kumar, a noted birder, who was able to considerably add to our list of Indian sightings. If you are a birder visiting Periyar then a day out with Raj is a must."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wildlife and men,"The place is a beatuful example of how men and nature can hel each other. The dam provided water to the cityes and also enhanced the surrounding forest and its wild life.  Now its house of tigers, elephants, wild boars, many birds, including the exotic kingfisher, different species of monkeys, all kiving in a nice system that is healthy visited by tourists."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Thekkady,We visited in the month of January with my family. We traveled from thrissur to kumily via idukki without touching kochi. We can see the idukki dam on the way. And we reached there @ kumily by 8 pm. I already booked the hotel at thekkady thru online in goibibo.com. so i got 60% discount on hotel tariff. I prefer online booking so dat u will get cheap price and u can select and confirm ur stay prior to ur reach at destination. If u go directly to the reception and ask the price definitely dey will tell u high amount for sure especially if late nite.. So plz book ur room thru online prior to ur journey. J will get nearly 30 to 50 % reduction in d price. Search for the coupon code for the particular website before u book. Tmrw early morning at 4:30am we rushed to the entrance to get our tickets confirmed as itz very difficult to get the tickets due to huge rush and limited seats in the boats. We can see a huge line at the entrance with their own vehicles. And after entering the entrance we can take our vehicle inside for 2 kms till the parking slot. After parking we can see all start running towards the ticket counter to place in the line. Anywy we got our tickets in our hands. The boating thru the periyar reserve is really awesome. U will love it for sure.. And also u can see animals on both sides if ur lucky. The best time to spot animals is in the afternoon as they will come out to drink water due to very hot. In the morning as the climate z cold animals wont come outside datmuch. The boat journey is for 1.5 hrs. ticket price 225 / person.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Well worth the early start!,"What a lovely experience this was - walking out early in the morning before it got too hot. The guides managed to find and show us dozens of wonderful birds along with a herd of bison with a baby, monkeys, deer and a herd of elephants. Much more wildlife seen than I was actually expecting - it's well worth a visit if you are in the area. Definitely recommended."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Well worth a visit,Loved all the clear labelling of the trees. Amazing to see plants and trees you have heard of but never seen. Just watch the monkeys cute little thieves
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Absolute bliss!,"Since the stay was in Anand Nivas (highly recommended place in Periyar - situated within Periyar tiger reserve itself). The Periyar reserve boat ride was just overlooking our room.. The staff arranged our boat ride as well, a blissful 2 hours boat ride on the largest river of Kerala. A tip: try n pre-book the ""first ride in the morning"" to get maximum wildlife coming out to the river for their early morning thirst. It will be a ride of a lifetime, no less than Jurassic park on a boat-ride ;). We saw Oaters, sambars, wild pigs, cormorants.. din't understand the fauna though, odd trees coming down the lake.. Overall a great experience! Will visit once more some day.."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Elephants,We were able to see herds of Elephants. The previous and next boat persons were not lucky but we were able to see many elephants which was a great here was a slight drizzle and hence the climate was enjoyable. Must see location during this season.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Wonderful scenery but, where we're the elephants?","Our group chose to embark on the 'sun rise' boat trip through the park, with the promise we would see the elephants bathing.  It is a beautiful place and well worth visiting for the views alone.  Sadly the elephants chose not to bathe on the morning we visited the park.  There was a faint grey figure moving slowly in the distance at one stage during the otherwise 'uneventful' 50-minute ride but speculation was rife amongst our small group it was a couple of the park wardens dressed in an animal suit.  Reminded me of the Rhino scene from Ace Ventura 2."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Very nice,"This is a must visit place.Very diffenrent experience. away from the city and jungle, animals,lake quite. Definitely very different experience."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"beautiful countryside, few animals - slept in the jungle camp","We booked a 2-day tour. First we had a boattour on the Periyar Lake, which was actually nice for seeing the landscape, eventough you are on that boat with around 50-80 tourists. We even saw two elephants and one buffalo, but only from far away.  Then we (3 guys) had a short hiking through the jungle with 2 guides, but we didn't see anything special.  Afterwards we went to our 'Jungle' Camp. When we booked it, we really expected it to be more inside the jungle. But we felt like in a normal summer camp. we even had electricity. Nothing special at all. Oh and regarding the food for this tour: we received like 3 or 4 meals, and it was really delicious! You won't have to take anything with you. They serve you enough food and water bottles.  On the next day we had a bus tour for like 3 hours. It was alright. Mainly because we 3 were the only tourists who booked it. Again it was nice for seeing the landscape, but we only saw a few animals.  All in all it was a nice stay in the nature, but we hoped that it would be more adventurous."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Trekking in the Wild,"Highly recommend the nature guided walks ( trekking ) in the park. We went on the 10am walk as the 7am was booked out. Our guide was very knowledgable, we saw lots of birds, animal tracks, monkeys and a giant squirrel. Even if we hadn't seen any animals it would still have been good just to walk in nature."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Just a boat ride,"The lake is beautiful but I had expected to see some animals or interesting birds or something. The boat holds a lot of people and was full, so if you're on the inside you won't see anything at all. I was on the outside and didn't see much besides some wild boar and a couple of common birds. I hope there's more to see at this place than we saw. Maybe they should close it off to all humans and just let nature repopulate it."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Tigers and elephants in a fantastic nature,"If you visit Kerala, you have to reserve a visit to the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary and Tiger reserve. They are in the same place, a wonderful National Park with very good guides fom the local tribes living in 45 small villages around this Parc. There are a little more than 1000 elephants and 44 registered tigers, that will not give themselves away for a photosession. But we had the chance to find a family of elephants. And lots of other animals. The facilities are excellent with breakfast cand lunch in nice surroundings and a boattrip on the lake.Lots of Indian touristes who liked to know where we come from and they were very eager to exchange with us. A memory for life, even without tigers! But at least we saw their footprint."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wildlife,It spears in large area. I saw the area around periyar lake and it was so beautiful and untouched. Wild life cannot be seen from boat as its just matter of right timing but KTDC offer stay inside and they offer many programs to see wild life
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A good experience!,"I went with absolutely zero expectations of sighting any wild animals and only wanted to enjoy the boat ride on this breathtakingly beautiful lake and wildlife sanctuary. However I was in for a pleasant surprise as I spotted an elephant with her calf, a herd of deer, foxes, wild boar and bison, besides some birds.  I thoroughly enjoyed the boat ride and the overall experience was very good.  Few things to remember to enjoy the boat ride at Periyar: 1. Always book your boat tickets in advance through their online site - (https://onlinebooking.periyarfoundation.org/PTR/ConfirmOrder?Name=Boating-Online) as its extremely difficult to source the same day tickets at the counter. 2. The upper deck seats offer a better view 3. If you have booked the tickets online, try and reach the place a good 45 minutes before as you will have to show the print out and get the tickets 4. There are no extra fees for the mobile camera however I believe they charge extra for a proper camera 5. Besides the online tickets you will also have to buy the entry pass which is available at the entrance of the wildlife sanctuary. 6. Be prepared to walk for a good 1 kilometer till the port from the car drop point 7. For infants do carry light woolen clothes as it tends to get a bit cold once you are on the boat inside the lake. 8. Binoculars will always give you a better view of the animals who are most of the time hidden behind the trees."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,"No Sightings of animals anymore, just go for good scenery and boating experience",I was told in advance by various sources that there are hardly any sightings of animals now at Periyar. It is just a good boating experience which is quite relaxing. The scenery around is beautiful - ask for upper deck in the boat for best views.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Overhyped Place,"This is overhyped place and not worth the effort. A lot of people told that one should take the first early morning trip inside the sanctuary so that one gets to see the animals that come out to drink water. But it was not worth the effort. We went in the winter and did not spot any animals, we only saw few birds. The only good part is that the boat ride which is a good experience."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wildlife without wild animals,We didn't find any wild animal except Monkey..or elephant or some deer. Greenery inside was very good and some good information on different variety of trees. Good for some quite time and some clicks..nothing more than that
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful sanctuary,"Very beautiful wildlife sanctuary, the lake offers a myriad glimpse of the birds and their nests on trumps of trees devoid of greenery standing like hermits in between the lake. Chance sightings of big reptiles, amidst dense forest cover leave you searching for more. Must take the early morning trip."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not seen any animals,Visited 2 hours thru boat ride but not seen any animals. we specially want to see elephants but couldnt see any.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wildlife Sanctuary without wild animals,"We left early morning from Munnar to reach this place on time so that we could see some animals quenching their thirst. But it was a real disaster as for the complete one & half hour boat ride, we could see only 1 deer & a few water crows. Apart from animals, the scenery was really good. The mountains, the greenery, the sky was absolutely peace of mind. Overall a not good experience but not that bad too. Thanks to the season we had been to."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good,"The place was good very far from Kochi. You can go for boat safari and jeep safari, but spotting tigers and elephants is very hard."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,No animal Spotting!,You barely see and animals apart from Deers. Not worth going as it takes good amount of your day time.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great day,Did the full day of bamboo rafting. I didn't have high expectations of seeing any animals as I know these things are hit or miss the walk was excellent. Knowledgable guides and rafting was good in quiet areas of park. We did get the bonus of seeing a herd of elephants beautiful countryside thoroughly enjoyed our day.
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Very bad organizing of ticketing,"Very very bad organizing of ticketing, Ticket taken at GATE is for only entry pass, they may not say even about that, language problem, no information counter at gate, without boating in Periyar lake waste of money to visit Thekkedy, nothing is there to see without boat ride with the Gate entry pass, Boat tickets also should be given at entry of gate then tourist can take his decision to go or not, but they organizing in wrong way, they will issue the entry pass at the gate ticket and we may not get the boating ticket, and at the boating ticket counter they will not issue ticket in correct way and they will speak rudely with tourists, there are only few boats and at gate they are issuing gate pass for all tourists, I can say that is a Business Logic."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Quite different than other sanctuaries,"I found this a bit different than others. We did not get ferry tickets (online or offline) as we travelled in Christmas vacation, so we just sat there for 30 minutes, clicked some photos on the entrance gate and returned. The way from the entrance to the lake is beautiful and provides good photography opportunities. It also gives us feeling that we are actually walking in jungle. The monkeys here are very notorious so do not take any eatables in your hands otherwise they will be snatched away. In a nutshell, I liked this place, but we would have liked it more if we would have got those ferry tickets."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A visit to Thekkady,"Thekkady offers an attractive outing option away from the hustle and bustle of urban life, more so if you have a liking towards nature, flora and fauna.  Local attractions are:  Lake boating – Boat trips are NOT well organised, probably because of the huge crowds and the minimal number of boats and trips available - Long queues, extended waiting time, lack of space. Very difficult to get tickets during week ends and during holidays. Many visitors get disappointed at not being able to secure boat rides, which is one of the major attraction points at Thekkady. Morning and evening trips are rewarding as animals put in an appearance near the water during these hours. Animals that are often seen are elephant, deer, wild boar, bison, fox, Malabar squirrel and of course a variety of birds.  Jungle trek for about three hours both during day time and night time. A nice way of experiencing and getting an intimate and first hand feel of the jungle. Have to get the tickets from the forest department office near the sanctuary gate. If you are staying in Periyar House and are taking the night jungle trek, pl enquire and arrange in advance the method of pickup and drop from the hotel as the trek starts and ends from the forest dept. office and not the hotel.  Elephant ride is available at the boat base.  We stayed at Periyar House at Thekkady. Periyar House is located inside the wild life sanctuary and is located between the sanctuary entrance and the boat boarding point. The accommodation is good for what one can expect in a wild life sanctuary. The hotel corridors are all open to the environment, unlike the claustrophobic interiors of city hotels and therefore provide an intimacy with the surroundings. The restaurant is neat with decent food. We could see wild boar, bison roaming quite close to the hotel even during day time. Possible to get boat tickets with more ease (if seats are available) if you are staying in Periyar House. Going out of the hotel either by walk or by vehicle late in the evening is not allowed, the location being inside the sanctuary."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Keep expectations in check and it will be enjoyable,"we started our walk at 7:30, just two of us and the guide. Although he spoke very little English, he had a very good eye and you could tell he knew the forest well. We saw a heard of bison, antelope, babbler, colourful woodpeckers, heard the hornbill and got pretty close to a Malabar pit viper. We saw very few people and just having the opportunity to walk a few kilometres in a quiet empty relatively untouched forest in India, a country of a billion people, is pretty amazing in itself. The guide had been working there for five years and had never seen a tiger as they are rare. If your expectations are reasonable, you won't be disappointed"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,badly organised ticketing and online information,"The way the ticketing and entry is organised is a fiasco. the main online site does not mention online booking for the boat ride.There is a separate site for that. Even once you have the boat ticket, the entry into the park is so disorganised, that we missed our boat ride and the money went waste, despite reaching over an hour earlier.You have to buy entry tickets, and the vehicle ticket only on the day of the ride The queues were so long, that we could not catch the ticket the day 7.30 boat. The entry ticket needs to be included with your boat ride ticket. and the option of getting your vehicle pass and entry tickets the day before needs to be there. Or like toll plazas on other roads, you should have many more than just one counter/station, where you buy your vehicle pass and entry ticket without getting out of the vehicle. thus we missed the boat ride. Even for the green walk, You get the ticket from the information counter. Entry is from one gate. you have to walk/drive back to the main entry gate a couple of kilometers away. ( with the same long queues), get your entry tickets, and go back the the other gate to start the walk. there also, they were short of guides, and we started our walk one hour late, till they finally found a guide for us. I must say that the other quide went out of his way to see that we were not left stranded, and helped get our guide organised ( he could just have left). and once we went in the reserve, it was excellent ( separately reviewed) THEY MUST MAKE THE BOOKING/TICKET/ENTRY SYSTEM MORE ORGANISED AND EFFICIENT"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Interesting but it depends on time of day and guide,"Worth the visit, if you are interested in seeing what the regions vegetation and fauna are like. It's really important to get hold of a good guide or guide group. On our first visit we were luck and trekked through water and small hills and saw some wildlife but on our second occasion my Husband went alone and had a poor guide who just gave him a basic walk which was pretty boring for him. Early morning and around sunset are best times to see the animals at their drinking holes."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Different experience,"Good for One day, Need to start early. Around 1500 per person with Jeep safari, food, guide tour, boating included. Animal sighting is rare. Boating, trekking can be done. Food is OK, pure veg."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,wild life sanctury,We couldn't find any animals as it was very windy and cloudy. walking upto the lake is one kilometre from the car parking. worth going to kerala. specially the periyar lake and the wildlife sanctury. boating is amazing. it was a motor boat af about 60 seater. and could see the elephant in the water swimming with it's trunk out.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,nature walk,"early morning nature walk from 7-45 to 10am, wasn't warned about the leeches so when we got there my daughter was terrified and hated the long socks they had to wear. spotted a few monkeys in the wild. our guide suresh was informative and was friendly. very tired. no children below 12yrs allowed as its a long walk."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,"no tigers, maybe 2 elephants","not worth of ur time if u expect wild animals when visiting during daytime. U will not see them, and the boats are too crowded. No experience with daylong trips, maybe they are better"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Bad service,"Too bad service of kerala tourism , dont give ticket if any one come from too far and for 1 day...in season increase boat , all are come to see it..third class service..."
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Waste of time and money,People go to Thekkady just to visit this place. I also went for the same reason. You need to pay 300+ per person to enter and what you get is a mere boat ride in middle of the forest. Unless you are very lucky you hardly get a chance to site any animals during the boat ride.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,just ok,"this is for which thekkedy is famous , but it is only boating in lake , with nice view of trees around . no animal can even seen , deer & wild pig can be watched in this trip . have to go , pls do not take infant for that ride , it is 2 hour ride so avoid it ."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary through boat ride,"Periyar lake boating experince is one of unique among all boating while in Kerala. Here the steamer will take you to the ride for 45 minutes inside the lake where you can see lots of birds and other species in learby Periyar park. Ofcourse in steamer, you have to adjust yourself so that you can enjoy the ride and see the birds otherwise it is very difficuly for the person sitting in the middle. The price oif boating has been increased extraordinary and it is very costly now (225/- per person a;lart from camera charges)"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,A jeep ride and a stroll in the woods.,Set off from Kumily at 5:30 by jeep which took us to a small lake where we had breakfast before embarking on a three hour trek (walk) in the forest. The walk was followed by lunch then a short rowing boat ride to a waterfall. Overall the day was useless as a wildlife watching experience. We loved most of our 3 week Kerala trip but this was a waste of a day and not worth the effort of getting there. Would not recommend it.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Excellent cruise,The wild life is excellent. We took the cruise which was about 1 1/2 hr. The guide explained if any bird/animal spotted. The Sanctuary is having night trekking. It is worth to stay at Periyal Forest Lodge or Aranya lodge run by KFTDC if you want to enjoy it.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,natures gift to mankind,"i could spot elephants, deer..saw pug marks..but couldnt watch many birds..i bought few mementos from their gift shop"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,A different experience,"The national park is developed on a very big landscape. In Malayalam Thekaddy means woods.  The entry for the national park is 65 rs / person and additional charge for your vehicle. The vehicles need to be parked at a particular place after which we have to walk. with trees surroiunding you and birds chirping around it is an amazing walk. Beware of the monkeys and do not keep any bag in your hand. they have a habit to snatch it considering it as food.  The national park can be seen only on a boat and need to buy a ticket for that. Charges : 225 Rs / pax and additional charge for camera. The boat leaves every 1.5 hrs. A good time to see animals will be in the evening at around 3. The park starts at 5:30 in the morning and closes at around 6. The boat has all rescue items and also staff of wild life santuary to take care of you.  I did see Sambhar deer, deer, wild buffalo and different types of birds. A worth visiting place. You can also take a private jeep to track you all along the jungle if you want. The charges for that will be approx 2000 Rs / pax."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,THEKKADY,"Thekkady located in the mountainous district of Kerala-Idukky,is one of the world most fascinating places to visit.Presending a panorama of majestic mountains and verdant valleyas draped in stuning green ,thekkady is the ultimate gate way for traveler looking for a tranquil holiday in the lap of nature.The vast stretches of plantations and luxuriant forest cover offering great trails ,make thekkady a trekker’s delight THE EXCOTIC WILDS Only 25 regions in the world are known for bio-diversity .Out of this only two are in india .they are the Himalayas and western ghats .With twelve wild life sanctuaries and two"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,We didn't see much wildlife,"We arrived by jeep at 6.30 am and proceeded to the sanctuary's central buildings by a lake where we had a good breakfast before departing on a three-hour hike in search of elephants and other wildlife. Although we had an excellent guide, we didn't see any elephants but did see monkeys and birdlife. We returned for a good lunch before departure."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great wildlife spotting and beautiful scenery,"We visited here in December and decided to go for the border trek over a Jeep safari and it was a great choice.  The trek was really enjoyable and we had three fantastic and knowledgeable guides. The trek lasts from 8 am until 5pm and covers about 20km so you need at least moderate fitness levels but apart from one small steep section the walk wasn't actually that physically challenging.  We saw plenty of wildlife ... Sambar and barking deer, nilgri langur monkeys, wild Indian goar, a cobra, eagles, lizards, birds, frogs and plenty of beautiful butterflies. No wild elephants this time - our guide said chances on this trek are usually 50:50. We also saw both tiger and leopard tracks and droppings. In addition to the animals, guides give really interesting information on all the local plants, fruits and herbs.  In a 945 sq km park of which is mostly forest, you have a slim chance of seeing one of the 46 tigers here but someone yesterday did so its not impossible. Obviously the longer you spend in the park, the better chances you have. However, if like a lot of the reviewers on here you are only interested in tigers, and other wildlife bores you - don't bother going to a wildlife sanctuary just go to a zoo. You need patience to see wild animals. They do not exist solely for your entertainment! Suggestions that you won't see anything are ridiculous.  The only downside of the trek was lunch and breakfast. You were given a paper bag will two boxes (one for breakfast, one for lunch) full of a selection of slightly stale bread and pastries. For lunch it was about 8 types!! An apple and a juice. So not great. You also have to carry the bag through the trek which is a bit of a pain so take a big bag with space. Also you only get 1 litre of water each which in the heat is not enough - so take extra!  Overall well worth a trip, even just to see the beautiful views of Kerala and Tamil Nadu!!!"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Waste of time...,"Extremely disappointing experience, I've seen more wildlife in my local park...Saw plenty of leeches and that's about it. Our guide spoke very little English and was extremely ignorant. He only started being nice walking back to office. I would seriously give this a miss."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Samud the Amazing Guide and Tuk Tuk driver in Kumily,"We stayed in Kumily to see the tigers. Unfortuately we went at the end of the monsoon when there was so much rain the animals didn't need to come to the lake to drink. So no tigers! Our Tuk Tuk driver and guide was Samud, an amazing man with knew all about the planets and herbs and was a source of information. We went to Spice gardens, tea and coffee plantations and factories and walked to waterfalls and view points. Highly recommend this man ...his number is +91 9567 233101. He also sorted out accommodation for us at the Meadow View with a little balcony looking towards the park, where we saw deer, mummy deer and daddy deer and a baby deer, a mongoose family playing, lots of water buffalow.... and wonderful birds. That cost us 750 rupees a night. Enjoy."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good Place,Its really relaxing to walk inside the sanctuary and the boating is also interesting.Can dwell with nature and be away from the busy life.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wht an experience,"We had booked the bamboo rafting trip. Almost as interesting as the rafting on the lake, was the walk to and from the lake with an armed ranger and his 2 helpers who spotted many animals for us"
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Highly Over rated,"We went for a safari through the boat and returned very disappointed...did not see any animals except for some pigs and wild dogs...also, the boat does not take you close to the shore where animals come...Thekaddy/Periyar can be given a miss"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,the wild elephants,"the wild elephants nearly charged at us! loved it! It was a sight for sore eyes!The baby elephant was playing in the water. The adults were very protective and when our cruise boat would not stop following them, they charged at us!adrenaline rush!"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Pathetic place !!!,"After taking an entry ticket for myself , wife & driver we were allowed to drive in 5 mins to reach spot from where you need to walk another 7-10 mins to reach ticket counter. Ticket counter has endless Queue dunno for what. You gotto be lucky everytime..People stand in queue for 1-2 hrs w/o guarantee of getting ticket in nearest schedule of boat departure. Then getting a place on deck again you need to be lucky since boat is stuffed with 70-80 passengers. Inspite of peak season they have hardly 4 boats. Now wait.... if you are lucky to get ticket, lucky to have a seat on deck, you then need to be lucky again to see an animal coming to drink water at shore also. So when all these things combine you may get what you have gone for. Sheer waste of time..Dunno if these ppl are seriously wanting to attract tourists ???"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Worst wildlife experience,"We visited periyar on a 3 day trip, including the tiger trail program. On our whole trip we could not see any wildlife, as the tour organised in periyar are in the buffer zone only, they dont allow tourists into the heart of the reserve. So if you are planning on witnessing any wildlife action, you are in for a total disaster. I have been to other sancturies like Kanha, pench, bandhavgarh, etc. all of which provide you with an experience behemothically superior to periyar. On the jungle trek we encountered a lot of leeches and everyone of us had to donate our blood to satiate their hunger. This is the only worth enjoying memory I have from the trip :P Until you are a fish lover, fooding is going to be a problem. However, you will find the best fishes you might have had. Language is a great barrier and you would be really lucky if you could find any person or even guide who can speak quality English or any other language except malyali. People are not too friendly too The boat ride increases your frustration level to the next level. No doubt the scenery is lavishly green, but apart from that the boats are rusty, again the language barrier and no wildlife. So it is a no no for a wildlife trip. Dont go."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Can not avoid it, but do not expect to see wild life","Long queue for tickets. Very badly organised. Better book on line to avoid queue. There is a counter inside for online booking, they sell 200 tickets. No wild animal worth mentioning. Actually it is not worth the trouble. Walking around is better"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,nice place,"very nice place for them who love nature, wildlife. for animal lovers you need to be patient to watch them. You need to be lucky to fine more animals there . but nice place to explore and enjoy."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Unforgettable,Seeing fresh tiger prints in mud. Fresh elephant dung on path. Witnessed charge of herd of bison. Rangers very informative and kind. Good English.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good place to visit,"Boat safari was good and had to wait in the queue. The ride is very unique and peaceful. If you are lucky, you get to see some wild life, we were not so lucky !!"
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Dissapointing!!,"I guess the rain did not help! No wild life as such, a couple of monkeys, deer and some birds. We were pleased when the trip ended early! 2 people actually fell asleep!!"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,good ride for family in boat enjoy,"Not seen much animal than dear, turtles, monkey & few birds but good ride for family in boat enjoy. now tickets can be booked online through periyarfoundation.org"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,greenish...!,superb.. many packages available. full green . must go : boating. but hard to spot tigers. greenish.
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Average with almost no wild life to see,Long waiting for the boat service. Kept us locked inside the boat during the sailing. Almost no visible animals. Money attacks are common and very frightening for adults and kids.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good guide though saw little,"A nice 2 hour walk through the tropical forest with a knowledgeable guide who ensured we had leech socks on. A few black monkeys, frogs, dragonflies and tadpoles and one elephant footprint were the only wildlife on offer but one got a nice feel for the tropical ecosystem and the tree canopy was beautiful and botanically diverse"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great Views & Adventurous... But...,We visited the lake on the boat ride in the early morning trip. This is the best time to see some animals... We saw only some deers and one mountain lizard... and birds many... but no tigers... The morning time is the best time for the cruise... and it is recommended to purchase the online ticket as it will enable to you to get a seat in the upper deck...
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,DONT GO TO THEKKADY AND KERALA,bro...dont go to thekkady...I made a mistake. there is nothing in periyar sanctuary. zero tourist management one has to stand up in que for atleast 5-6 hours to get boat ticket for periyar cruise. you could hardly find a deer in entire ride..periyar lake sucks entire day..nothing special..very poor management.i would suggest u all to skip kerala tour. nothing is special in entire kerala..mismanagment is every where..at tourist spot there is que..each que takes ur 4-5 hrs..go to traditional hillstations..i wasted my 10 days on this bloody trip..
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great jungle trek!,"We did a 3 hour jungle trek through Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary followed by a boat ride to the waterfall and would definitely recommend it.  The experience was really exciting and the tour guide, JoJo, was fantastic. His knowledge of the local area and interesting stories added to the whole experience."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,The only way to experience wildlife here is by going on the tiger trail.,The only way to experience wildlife here is by going on the tiger trail. You are absolutely unlikely to experience wildlife on their jeep safari's & boar rides.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Walk in the park,"To be honest, the three hour Nature Walk was not all that easy; it took in some steep and rugged terrain, in hot, humid and (eventually) rainy conditions. I also ended up attached to some leeches. But the views ate definitely worth it, as are the lessons from your guides into the indigenous plants, animals and people. And it's immeasurably improved if you see any of the animals. Although animal can't be guaranteed, as an example I saw deer, languar, some rare birds, tiger prints (though no actual tigers), a giant tree squirrel and, from a fair distance, a family of elephants. Mant thanks to my guides for their efforts."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Backpackers beware!,"We were really disappointed with a trip to the sanctuary.  We wanted more of an adventure so avoided the expensive all inclusive tours advertised everywhere and made our own way to the sanctuary.  We paid the 300rs entrance fee and walked 3k along a road to the 'information centre', which was little more than a room full of adverts for hotels and more tours. Here we found out that the only way to enter the park is if you pay for a tour. There is a 'self-guided walking tour' costing a further 300rs, however tickets can only be obtained from outside the park.  Frustrated by the burocracy we went on an underwhelming boat ride and left the park feeling like we just went to Disneyland, but Rajah was nowhere to be seen."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,"beautiful, quiet and green.","clean, green and peaceful. we took a boat ride through the lake and though we didn't see wild tigers or elephants, it was a nice respite from the busy, dirty, chaos of indian streets."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Long ques, noisy boat ride, and alas! Not an animal spotted","Kerala has magnanimous beauty and to experience it you definitely do not need this noisy boat ride. It was like travelling in a public bus where people were conversing with others from their group sitting rows ahead and behind; food kept pouring out from boxes producing a stench that wild animals would burry their noses, if not themselves deep in Earth and unianimously conspire to be not seen by the inhabitants of the boat. Read more about it in my blog www.joyfultravelpie.com to plan the most memorable trip to Kerala."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful!!!!,The sight of these green terraced farms is a treat to the eyes...they are everywhere and the tata tea ones are considered the best. Most have barbed wire fencings but as u go upwards u find ones that are accessible. A supremely photogenic site and the teas are a must buy
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Heaven on Earth (While raining),"Excellent place. Saw Elephant. Main attraction was lake in the middle of the forest. Decent food by the tourism department. It was raining. The waterfall (accessible only through boat) is excellent. During the boat ride, the nature was covered by mist. It started raining heavily. Visibility was very less. View was excellent. Out of the world. Experienced guide brought us back safely."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,good,wildlife sanctury is very nice. they arrang tribal dances in evening. you can explore wildlife with many options...with the kind of traveller you are. night life camping and touring in sanctury is also available. very beautiful
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,nice quiet clean place,well maintained place. all trees are identified and labelled very good place to walk through the woods
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Patience has its rewards,"Any visit to any wildlife sanctuary needs to be taken with a large dose of patience. Wild animals are naturally shy and when there's water and food in abundance all around there's no real reason for them to come close to the water's edge to look at the tourists on the boats. I have seen people here complain that they couldn't see anything but these people miss the point that the process takes time, and luck. Each National Geographic wildlife movie takes about five years to make on an average - you see it compressed into 90 minutes and therefore expect to have a tiger or an elephant jump into your arms when you visit a wildlife reserve. Thekkady, after my last visit in 1997, has cleaned up its act - nice drives, ticket counters though somewhat disorganised that work, boats that work...much staff to man the boats etc., We went on the boats a couple of times and were fortunate to see an elephant and calf, bison, boar, bear, deer and unfortunate to miss a leopard which came to the water's edge but which the people in the boat ahead saw. The lake is as beautiful as it was the first time I saw it, the vegetation is just as thick - that's something you cannot say of the rest of the world. Visit and take your chance and feel fortunate when and if you see an animal in its natural setting..."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,True nature in view despite man-made intervention,"To do justice to the title of this review, it is important to put in context that it was the Mullaperiyar Dam built by the British, now ""maintained"" by the Tamil Nadu state government, which led to the creation of the ""lake"" or deep water body. This led to an eco-system that is evergreen, even in the dry summer time. Thankfully, the Kerala state government decided to ensure that over 900 acres of pristine nature area were secured as the Periyar Tiger Reserve - PTR (know by many as the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary). The word ""reserve"" or ""sanctuary"" does sadly mean away from human influence - which is usually of the negative sort.  A fact, I would like to point out, is that PTR is a place for wild life to flourish as it is. Not for humans to destroy or profit from. Yet, as with any other such reserve, PTR too needs the monetary sources such as sale of boating tickets, souvenirs, etc. to support the functioning, especially of the forest department with field staff such as watchmen, guards, rangers, etc. who do an amazing job keeping the forest secure from poachers and other humans who would rather destroy beauty for short term profit than enjoy it and keep it flourishing for future generations of ours.  In the context of above, the best time to visit PTR is actually March-April of any year, when it is summer. Take the first boat ride and chances are very high that some of the wild life may be visible. Do first, take some time out to check out the very informative photos kept near the boat landing area to understand the unique wild life that actually exists in PTR. Secondly, when on the boat keep silent and encourage everyone to remain silent. What people do not understand is that the volume levels of humans chattering and jabbering away are so high, and so easily carried over the water surface that animals tend to shy away. By being silent, there is still a possibility that in an undisturbed environment, the animals may go on with their usual life, allowing us to glimpse their beauty.  Lastly, ask any wildlife enthusiast, and the answer will be ""if you are lucky, you will spot some of the wildlife"". This is a fact, and bemoaning about not seeing any animals just is not done. Also do consider the difference between a picnic and a pilgrimage. PTR is one of the most verdant natural areas that can showcase an amazing diversity of wildlife if you just really look. On my multitude of trips, I have seen some of the most amazing things in life. If you have not seen the great hornbill land, you have not seen aerodynamics in motion. If you have not watched the Indian gaur amble through, you have not seen 1600 kilos of muscle in fluid motion. I could go on and on, but then you need to experience it yourself. Go to PTR, don't go for just a boat ride. Stay around. Trek. And spread the good word. We are in dire need of such spaces."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Wildlife, not so wild","We visit a wildlife sanctuary to see really ""wild"" animals. If you are expecting carnivores like tigers and leopards you will be disappointed. However for a true animal lover this is a great place. You get to see timid animals like buffaloes, elephants, turtles, monkeys and deers. It is advisable that one visits the place armed with a good binocular, as most of the animals are usually sighted from a motorized boat. With humans in the middle of the lake and animals roaming near shore, it is not a very comfortable situation for a tourist. Animals have better privacy though.  Uploading some pictures I clicked."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not child friendly,"Nothing really for families, all the treks are for kids over 12 so if you are travelling with young ones, DON'T go to periyar, apart from a very commercial elephant ride outside of the park, there is nothing for young ones to do inside, and the monkeys are pretty scary around the ice cream point!"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not so wild!!,"During our kerala tour in thekkady have visited ""Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary"" we found few animal mangoose,dear & offcourse many species of Birds.only hezard was to book ticket well in advance (u can book through net too Gr8) me & my driver wake-up early morning @ 5.30 for tickets."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good to have not Must have,Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary boat ride is good to have not must have and its better you take the early morning ride so that you get the entire day to do other things. However make sure you book your tickets online in advance to save time at the ticket counter and chances of getting ticket at the counter is very low so online booking is best option. However if you too desperate to take this ride there is government transit office near boating place which sells tickets at premium price. choice is yours!!!
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Absolutely avoidable,"Like - nothing Disliked - no animals, its a pain to get tickets, we really had to go early in the morning to grab tickets and boy what a complicated process it is. There is always a long queue, had to literally run kms. to reach the ticket counter. If you are late you miss that boat. Boating experience - disaster - Its like more than a couple of hours of very slow boating where except for some monkeys and birds you dont' see any other animal."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Tough to spot,"Like in most reserve forests in South India, it is really tough to spot wild animals. Of course you get to see elephants, birds, deer and a few other animals that aren't exciting. If you are a bird watcher, you will surely be happy.Plan and book your tours well ahead or they could be sold out. Spotting tigers is a matter of luck. I have been on 6-7 safaris in south India and I have never seen a tiger in the wild."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,beautiful place serene,"Take the trekking and raft trip , you get to see a lot of birds and walk through the jungle with forest guards .lucky if you see wild elephants . tiger"
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Total disappointment!,"We were very disappointed with the way the sanctuary works! They charge foreign nationals a much higher entrance fees and when we got in, the only attraction being the boating was not available anymore. I think this can be easily communicated to the front office and people wouldn't have to pay the entrance fees just to go it and get disappointed. When we asked the staff of there was anything else to do, they just told us there was nothing and that was it. We were told later that even the boating can be disappointing as the wild animals may not even be visible. Totally would not recommend this place!!!!"
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Human life trying to blend with wild life.,Attempts are made many times by human being to learn about wild life through various method. This sanctuary is also an example where the wild animals are free while human has selected to be within certain limits. May be due to rainy season we could not see much of the wild animals
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wild Life sanctuary with less of wild life,Visit this place for the feel of jungle and not for expecting any wild life. The trek is good and the guides are very cordial and helpful. The boat ride inside the complex take you right upto the waterfall and the view is just fantastic. The tickets include breakfast and lunch as well as tea and snacks. A visit a must if one is visiting Thekaddy.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Place to see beautiful wild birds,Best place to see and know many wild birds and sometimes few endangered birds too. Wild animals do come out only during the early mornings. Good place for nature lovers.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nice Spot,Have seen endangered spices like lion-tailed macaque. Its spread across a wide area. It was a beautiful experience overall .
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,just a drive through the forest with no animals in sight !!,"i had gone there in Dec. 2 yrs back.didn't see many animals except 2 elephants, some monkeys,few deers n birds- may be because of v cold early morning !!"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful Scenic view,"We go in the Month Of JUNE 2014 and have a morning ride thru boat in Lake periyar. Awesome experience to see dense forest having wild boars, elephants, dear and buffalo. Medium rain was there continuously which is making our day. Nice and beautiful scenic beauty in our front seems that we are watching some Wallpaper in our Laptop. Overall good experience, if you have time then must go."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Nice at night, crowded at daylight","If you want to repeat the boat disaster, don't forget to get on it. To much controlled nearby park gates environment, better to look to do some trekking away from main entrance. Some deers and bisons to see, none elephants, either tigers."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A lovely nature walk,"What we got to know a bit late in the day is that Kerela tourism operates a lot of activities inside the wildlife sabctuary, there is a night safari that starts at 3 different times at night and early morning. What we could take was a nature walk early next morning. It was a guided tour along a trail along teh forest and inside it. A lovely morning walk when we saw a few birds. It does get scary at times when the guide points to droppings or foot marks of dangerous animals like bison or a tiger and tells you that the marks are very fresh. Beware of the leeches though that are there in thousands expeciually in the rainy season. The guide do however provide you with protective gear to wear over your socks to protect you from the leeches."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Average,"This happened in Feb 2013 (reviewing a year later)  We booked the first boat at around 7am. The walk to the boat was nice, the air was fresh on a cold morning.  The boat ride was average - there not much animals by the river - we only spotted some wild boar and gaur (indian bison) and nothing else.  Apart from feeling the freezy cold weather, it wasn't very great.  Do not have great expectation of animal sighting when deciding on this site."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nothing really great,"The sanctuary is amazingly large, and the Periyar lake is spread over a huge area. The boating in lake happens through the large 40 seater boat and takes you to a pretty far distance. However, you will be disappointed if you want to see any wild animals. We could only spot a few herds of deer and gaurs, and an elephant with calf on the lake side. The greenry is pretty good and can be enjoyed, and several types of birds can be seen with ease (relatively).  Caution: There are a lot of notorious monkeys near the area where tickets for boat rides are sold and can be a real head ache. You need to watch out for them. It is just not recommended to carry any food item in hand or bag, as they'll simply loot it away."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Early morning wildlife adventure.,There were almost no animals ..there were a few birds. I found it quite a let down . We were given a very good seat in the second row on the boat ..but there was really nothing to see.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Walk on the not so wild side,"Good to get out into the Sanctuary. We did not expect to see any elephants as too late in the morning but the walk was very enjoyable and informative. However, did see a mongoose which made up for the lack of elephants"
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,An awesome place for a holiday in the middle of the forest,"A terrific place for a holiday. We stayed in a tent accommodation provided by the Forest Department. Great food, excellent support staff, helpful guides and a splendid holiday.  There is an early morning jungle safari, trekking and boating. Saw many wild animals.  Anyone wishing to stay away from the busy world can choose this place. No television, no music and no mobile connectivity. Such a great place to relax and be back to yourself.  Feeling so refreshed."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar nature reserve jeep safari,"Don't get your hopes up. It wasn't really worth the money. We paid for a full day's experience and expected one but actually found ourselves sitting around for hours. On arrival there was a fairly long wait before breakfast, which was a pretty nice South Indian buffet but not amazing. Then we spent the next couple of hours on our jungle trek, which was pleasant but we didn't see a lot. We had lots of fresh clues from elephants who'd recently left their trail of imprints and dung but no luck in seeing any. We did however see some giant squirrels, monkeys and a great hornbill bird. In fact, we probably got the best spots on our jeep ride into the park, where we periodically stopped when our drivers spotted something - including a gaur (bison), deer and a small family of elephants in the distance. Anyway back to the trek - we were told that a spice plantation and a temple were included in our programme, which were in fact just some cardamom plants and the odd cinnamon and frankincense tree shown to us as part of our trek and the temple we only saw from a great distance from the top of a hill, again as part of the trek. After the trek the experience was pretty much over with several hours left to go for lunch and a boat ride across a lake. We actually skipped the boat ride as it seemed unappealing as the lake itself was tiny and you couldn't really see any wildlife anyway. So we spent a few hours just sitting around before it was time to leave, which was in fact earlier than scheduled on the itinerary. We literally had time for an afternoon nap!"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,A rainy visit,We visited this wild life sanctuary rather late in afternoon. Our visit was spoiled by heavy showers and could get glimpse of few elephants and dears.
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Do the jungle walk,We went for morning jungle walk in the sanctuary. It lasts about three hours and there are 2-3 different routes which can be taken. The guide was very knowledgeable and gave information about various plants and trees and local history. We did not get to see many animals but the walk experience was fantastic. This is much better option than the boat ride.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,I got to see elephants!,"This was a wonderful experience as I was lucky enough to see a mother and baby elephant walking along the lakeside. I think to see the animals, you have to be on the first boat out in the morning, but it's well worth the early morning wake up call. Not only do you get to see animals in their natural environment, but the area itself is serene and beautiful and there is definitely something magical about the place. Definitely a place to visit if staying in Thekkady.  I"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,"A Magical time in the Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary, Thekkady, Kerala.","If your looking for a bit of adventure look no further than spending some time in the Periyar jungle. There is the excellent Tiger Trail which you get to camp in the jungle which proved to be very exciting and you are in safe hands with the experiencednd trackers a guides. I also stayed at the Gavi Eco huts and was again in the capable hands of a local guide called Raj. His experience and knowledge was fascinating and he certainly went out of his way to make the treks memorable. I also went on the bamboo rafting which was a gentle way of seeing the wild life that was on offer in the park. It has to be said that there was some confusion and poor attitude at the Eco tourism office. A private company has just taken over and would benefit from being taught a few customer relation skills. I wouldn't have been able to do any of this if hadn't been for a guy called Binu. His experience of working in the park was invaluable and he certainly helped me in saving money in planning and booking the attractions I opted to go on during my stay,he also provided a reasonable car service.I understand he will have a website up and running soon but until he does you can contact him at binus29@yahoo.com He will help assist and advise you with the many attractions and make sure your not paying over the odds as there are many private agents that are only to keen to over charge. I can't thank Binu enough for all his help, I had a great time and his help and advise was second to none. I look forward to visiting the park again and when I do I'll be in touch with Binu."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Pre-monsoon,"We travelled to Periyar in March 2014. The lake was very low and not much in the way of Wildlife to be seen. The lake boat trips are very well run and organised. Some confusion about all the tickets one has to purchase, however once sorted I am sure would be an excellent day after the monsoons, more water and more animals. Early morning trips would probably produce more animals coming out of the forest to feed on the grasslands."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Many Thanks to Ranger Raj!,"An early morning's Nature Walk with one of the local guides, Raj, was excellent. There's a bit of bureaucracy with permits to enter the park in addition to paying for the trip (why couldn't it be all included in the payment!), but otherwise highly recommended. Don't do the boat trip…noisy, crowded..and we could tell without being on it! Otherwise great scenery, the morning light was exceptional across the lake and the wildlife very interesting. Great birds (e.g. Malabar Trogon, Brown Fish Owl, Asian Paradise Flycatcher for the Birder on the trip), super mammals (Malabar Giant Squirrel, Gaur, Wild Boar, Red Mongoose), and a few insects/butterfly and of course flowers and trees. All pointed out by our guide, a local tribesman, Raj. Highly enjoyable for the small (3 person) party. Would definitely do it again."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Bamboo trek and raft tour,"We decided to do the half day as it is pretty hot here now and it started at 7.30am. It was perfect! We were given a picnic bag with breakfast and a bottle of water and set off with our two rangers and a man with a gun - just to be safe!  We were so lucky as we immediately saw monkeys, different types of squirrels, some bison and many birds. But then we came across about 5 elephants - our rangers immediately took us carefully away so as not to disturb them but we got a fabulous view of the whole family. We then went on the raft which is beautiful scenery and saw even more elephants on the trek back - amazing!  They do recommend ladies wearing long trousers and dark clothing and the loo is the wide open space - just FYI !"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Take a private tour with a ranger.,I was lucky enough to take a private early morning tour with a total of 3 and a ranger. We got very close to bysons and 4 female elephants with 4 youngs. Very rewarding. No tigers... next time!
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Awesome ride,we just enjoyed the boat ride. Good thing is we sighted wild animals for more than 2-3 occasions. So tiger spotting this time. May be will try my luck next time.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Good walk,"Best bit about the park was the early morning walk. We didn't see a lot but the sounds and early morning was great. The boat ride was shocking with poor views and all boats leaving at the same time. Didn't get a window seat, people fell asleep. Monkeys were amusing and saw lots of elephants, bison, deer and many birds. Bit disappointing as a wildlife park."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Take a walking Tour,Although the park is very busy a walking tour really feels that you are away from the crowds. We spent a magic half hour sitting on a hill watching wild elephants feeding
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Getting close to Nature,"We went on one of the first jungle walks of the morning-any later and I would imagine the crowds spoil any experience. Lots of interesting birds, a wild elephant in the distance, thousands of frogs and various exotic plants. A little disappointing in that we did not see more mammals but nevertheless a lovely walk."
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Experience the Wildlife on their own land,"This was a first of a kind experience for me and my wife. Seeing the wild in the wild, uninhibited. You watch them from a safe distance and they are undisturbed by the human antics as well. So, possibly the best way to enjoy the nature and it's offerings"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Excellent bamboo rafting,"We had been to Thekkady for a short family trip. We were recommended the bamboo rafting trip by quite a few people so we decided to go ahead with it. Now for the pluses: It was just too good. The trip started around 8AM after gathering at the office of the forest people. There they explained the details of the trip to all of us with instructions. We started off with a short walk and crossed the river by a small raft. Then started the long walk through the forest and it was dense. We rarely spotted any animals, just a herd of wild elephants who appeared aggressive so we had to move out hastily. We also saw a couple of black monkeys. After the walk, we had bamboo rafting for quite some time wherein you get a chance to row too. You row out to a distant place, have your lunch, walk again in the jungle where if you are lucky, you may get some more animal sighting. And then your row back and walk again till your reach the starting point. It really is a beautiful experience where you get a chance to see unpolluted nature at its best. Minuses: The details of the trip should be highlighted during the advertisement itself. It is not for people who are unable to make long treks. There is long walking involved so you need to be geared up accordingly with appropriate clothes and less weight to carry. There is danger of leech bites too, my daughter had 4 leech bites, so need to be told about what to wear. They give you boxes of packed breakfast and lunch and you have to carry them yourselves through out the whole trip. The food is very dry and mainly consists of bakery good and by the time you sit to lunch, you notice the things are very soggy and uneatable. Too dry. They should give the food where there is a camping site. It can be freshly prepared. No tea is served at all which would be most welcome and appreciated considering you are in the tea pocket of the country. For 2000 bucks they should be giving more."
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Superb...,Overall Thekkady experience was awesome...it was started with Jeep safari where we traveled in thick forest with TN and Kerala borders on both sides. After that we did lot of shopping and visited spice gardens. Rangerwood is one of best resorts to stay here. Overall it was nice experience...
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Not so bad,"We had planned to avoid to Periyar as everything I read sounded negative. But it fitted in to our circuit and our homestay (Manayath Heritage) definitely made it worth being in the area. We booked the 9.30 half day bamboo raft trip at midday the day before, the 7.30 one being full. The walk to the raft was enjoyable, with helpful guides through the forest: plants, birds, fantastic butterflies galore and even a few elephants. We were given lunch (very stodgy) and water which we ate in an uninspiring but shady concrete building, toilet facilities behind a tree! The raft trip was in the middle of the day so no expectation of seeing animals, but some people fishing and birds. Pleasant but not worth the detour, and any longer on the raft would be uncomfortable. On the walk back, we got closer to an elephant - and it was good that the guides were happy to stay and watch rather than hurry us on. Worth a visit? Hard to say. I'd think the chance of seeing elephants is reasonable. A visitor at our homestay a week before did see a tiger, but I reckon the chance is infinitisemal. I'm glad we didn't go on a motor boat although I gather they go earlier."
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Bamboo Rafting - Half day trip,"The real low point of a visit to India. Inhospitable booking system and reception staff. Two hours walk with poorly trained guides, food in a bare concrete shelter surround by toilet paper, and 50 minutes on a semi-submerged bamboo raft on half empty reservoir."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Walk, walk, walk and more walk","Since we had not time nor the inclination for the Jungle patrol at night or the daylong/ half day bamboo rafting after the 1 1/2 hour boat ride, we plumped for the 3 hour nature walk in the hope of seeing some elephants. But alas- we did not.. we only saw a giant squirrel, some birds and as a bad joke- some elephant bones! The guide told us that only foreigners usually go for such programs - most Indians would think the idea of paying for going on a long walk to be absurd!"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Great reserve,"The lungs of Kerala, teemed with wild life. well maintained. Optimum tourism without disturbing the tranquil of nature"
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Bamboo Rafting Full Day Trip,"I and My Wife reached in the morning at 8.00 a.m. at boating center and were guided to a path down towards a hut...... our meeting point for bamboo rafting tour. we had already booked for the trek two days earlier as they allow only limited people in the forest and it always booked by the foreigners. after handing us our food packets for breakfast and lunch, we were headed by the team of 6 forest guards into forest. After walking for 2 hours in the dense forest, we reached open space where we had our break fast. Post breakfast we headed to our raft made of bamboo and ventured into the water. rafting through the clear water into mid of the forest is divine experience. while rafting we did not see any elephants but saw many species of birds. After almost rafting for an hour we reached our resting point where we all kept our back packs and post resting for 10 minutes we again started walking into dense forest. only walking few minutes we heard our guards whispering with each other and we were guided by our guide to our first wild elephant of the day. Watching the elephant for few minutes in its own world we ventured further not knowing what is stored for us ahead. I think it was our luck day that gain just walking for other half an hour we saw the group of wild elephants (5 - 6) strolling just few meters from us and this sight made our day. Just watching them in their natural habitat we just forgot the danger of being so close to them and majorly that wind was blowing from our back side towards elephants and that they cam smell us. realizing this our guards just drew us from there towards safe area but this was not the end. moving further we saw other few elephants and bison. again we reached our resting point for lunch break. As many wild elephants we roaming around our trek area our guide decided for safety of all we will not be venturing further into jungle and will rest for few hours near the lake and head back to back to boating center. After resting for few hours we started our journey back. Around 5.00 p.m. we reached back to boating center,ending of our mesmerising and adventurous day."
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,"No animals, long waiting, no prebooking","Go to see another national park. the booking methodology does not allow you to go into the park at dawn but you wait at the gates and if you are lucky you get a jeep to get in. By the time you manage to do that, animals are gone."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Nothing much to do,Its bit boring if you skip the boat ride. which is usually booked. We paid 140 Rs for 4 people and a car for something we can experience any forest in the Kerala.
10,PeriyarTigerReserve,Ticket are blacked as online booking,I faced problem getting ticket for Periyar Tiger Reserve as ticket amounting Rs150 was blacked for Rs500 as online booking. I was waiting from 8:30 am on ticket counter for 9:30am boat ticket. But counter got open on 9:30 and informed us that ticket is full and will get ticket for 11:30 boat. It was ridicule’s employee at counter lying that we gave ticket before 8 am so it was full. Even employee were not talking properly when questioned without opening the counter how ticket got full so they started avoiding us. Even officer over there are not polite to talk.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,"Many birds, some mammals, no tigers","A guide can take you for a three hour trek pointing out birds, mammals, and butterflies. Saw wild Gaur, boars, storks, mongoose, Malabar Parakeets, a Hornbill, Nilgiri Langur monkeys, and a black antlered deer but no tigers or elephants although their scat was everywhere. Bamboo raft gets you across the water. Take water, binoculars, and go as early as you can to see wildlife."
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Overated,We set off early in the morning & had a walk with a very lack lustre guide who seemed bored with his job. Apart from a mongoose saw no wild life. It was probably the low point of our holiday in India.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Beautiful,Take the early morning boat and u might get lucky enough to spot different species of birds. Evening rides are also a good option. U might not want to go for a full day package but the boat ride was worth every penny. Beautiful place.
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary,Who should visit?: Everyone Duration of visit: 4 hrs Entry fees: Yes Best Part: Spotted elephants How to reach?: Taxi from Kochi Can you take pictures?: Yes Souvenir to purchase: Not much
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,We were lucky,"Look, let me clarify we didn't see any Tigers! But we saw at least 6 families of Elephants & to us, that's being lucky. Boat ride isn't very comfy - kind of cramped sitting arrangement. But that's OK - so long you get to see wild life which we did. Try & take the afternoon boat safari - chances of wildlife sighting generally higher in the afternoons."
50,PeriyarTigerReserve,Amazing,"Boat ride was too good. Its better to choose for early morning Boat ride. there are lots of options avaiable such as tiger trail, bamboo rafting etc.."
30,PeriyarTigerReserve,Scenic but not worth 1.5 hours!!!,I would recommend this place only if you have spare time. The scenic beauty is good but it dies after a while because you dont see anything else for the entire trip. They tell you may see wild animals on the banks but chances are very slim to none.
40,PeriyarTigerReserve,Periyar wildlife sanctuary near Thekkady in Kerala- nature's gift.,"Periyar wildlife sanctuary near Thekkady in Kerala (India) is better known for its natural beauty. Visit of the sanctuary in motor boats operated by Forest Department and Kerala Tourism Development Corporation through the lake gives a unique feeling. Lake is very big in its length and it may take around two hours to travel small stretch of the vast lake for travelling distance of about five -six kilometers on one direction. On both sides of the lake very dense forest are witnessed with varieties of trees and forest animals including elephants, forest buffalos, deers, tigers etc. Different types of Animals can be seen occasionally. Motor boats are advised to sail in the middle of lake as precautionary measures from any untoward incident caused by sudden appearance of the furious forest animals. Green scenery of nearby spots adds to the entertainment of people to great extent. In case any one is on picnic during his holiday to Kerala, visit to this wild life sanctuary is advisable at least once in life time. It is one of the most beautiful wild life sanctuary in the world and it is unforgettable. Subhash Lather"
45,PeriyarTigerReserve,Wild side to Thekkady,My husband and I travelled to Kerala for our Honeymoon and Thekkady was the second place to visit on our itinerary since we had heard so much about the scenic beauty of the place teamed with an opportunity to explore the Periyar Tiger Reserve and go on the Jeep Safari. Unfortunately for us the tickets for the safari were all sold out. Apparently only 100 tickets are sold everyday. My recommendation to everyone would be to try and pre book tickets for the safari if it is something you wish to enjoy. We ended up going for a Boat ride along the Periyar river. We only managed to spot a deer on a faraway river bank but you get a chance to spot some beautiful birds along the way. Always keep your camera ready to get some good shots.
20,PeriyarTigerReserve,Simply a rip-off,"Recommended by all travel guides, the Periyar Tiger Reserve or Periyar National Park is one big disappointment. At the entrance, visitors will be charged 300 rupees to get inside, with no information that besides boating (if you are willing to wait in front of the counter at least half an hour before it opens only to get a half-hour boat trip where you will hardly see any animals beside boars) you can do absolutely nothing inside the park. The boat-jetty is far from the entrance, so you better take a tuktuk to move along. All activities have to be booked outside the park at the forest department information center in Thekkady. Conclusion: Either were any of the authors ever there or things have changed quite fast...almost all essential information is missing in the guides (Lonely planet, Dumont, Barkemeier, Stefan Lose). Decide and book your preferred activity in advance!"
