## 🚀 Overview

Akhand Bharat is a unified, AI-powered platform designed to bridge India's rich cultural heritage with responsible, personalized tourism experiences. Our platform combines multiple advanced technologies to allow tourists to discover hidden gems, support local communities, and preserve cultural traditions.

## 🎯 Problem We Are Solving

India’s cultural heritage remains fragmented, difficult to access, and poorly integrated across existing tourism platforms. Current solutions fail to:

- Integrate traditional art forms (dance, heritage, festivals)
- Leverage seasonal trends and real-time data for recommendations
- Offer personalized user experiences
- Support local communities and artisans

## 💡 Solution Components

- **Dance Form Classifier:** Deep Learning CNN model to classify Indian classical dance forms from uploaded images.
- **Personalized Tourism Recommendation System:** Suggests cultural experiences based on interests, location, and preferences.
- **Trending Destinations Analysis:** Uses seasonal, festival, and government data to recommend emerging destinations.
- **Cultural Heritage Insights:** Database of places, festivals, monuments, art forms.
- **User Feedback Loop:** Allows tourists to rate destinations, improving recommendations.
- **Scalable Cloud Platform:** Built with Snowflake (Data Warehouse) and Streamlit (Interactive Web App).
